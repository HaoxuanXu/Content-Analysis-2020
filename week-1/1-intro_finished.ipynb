      "In computer science, artificial intelligence (AI), sometimes called machine intelligence, is intelligence demonstrated by machines, in contrast to the natural intelligence displayed by humans. Leading AI textbooks define the field as the study of \"intelligent agents\": any device that perceives its environment and takes actions that maximize its chance of successfully achieving its goals.[1] Colloquially, the term \"artificial intelligence\" is often used to describe machines (or computers) that mimic \"cognitive\" functions that humans associate with the human mind, such as \"learning\" and \"problem solving\".[2]\n",
      "\n",
      "As machines become increasingly capable, tasks considered to require \"intelligence\" are often removed from the definition of AI, a phenomenon known as the AI effect.[3] A quip in Tesler's Theorem says \"AI is whatever hasn't been done yet.\"[4] For instance, optical character recognition is frequently excluded from things considered to be AI, having become a routine technology.[5] Modern machine capabilities generally classified as AI include successfully understanding human speech,[6] competing at the highest level in strategic game systems (such as chess and Go),[7] autonomously operating cars, intelligent routing in content delivery networks, and military simulations.\n",
      "\n",
      "Artificial intelligence was founded as an academic discipline in 1956, and in the years since has experienced several waves of optimism,[8][9] followed by disappointment and the loss of funding (known as an \"AI winter\"),[10][11] followed by new approaches, success and renewed funding.[9][12] For most of its history, AI research has been divided into subfields that often fail to communicate with each other.[13] These sub-fields are based on technical considerations, such as particular goals (e.g. \"robotics\" or \"machine learning\"),[14] the use of particular tools (\"logic\" or artificial neural networks), or deep philosophical differences.[15][16][17] Subfields have also been based on social factors (particular institutions or the work of particular researchers).[13]\n",
      "\n",
      "The traditional problems (or goals) of AI research include reasoning, knowledge representation, planning, learning, natural language processing, perception and the ability to move and manipulate objects.[14] General intelligence is among the field's long-term goals.[18] Approaches include statistical methods, computational intelligence, and traditional symbolic AI. Many tools are used in AI, including versions of search and mathematical optimization, artificial neural networks, and methods based on statistics, probability and economics. The AI field draws upon computer science, information engineering, mathematics, psychology, linguistics, philosophy, and many other fields.\n",
      "\n",
      "The field was founded on the assumption that human intelligence \"can be so precisely described that a machine can be made to simulate it\".[19] This raises philosophical arguments about the nature of the mind and the ethics of creating artificial beings endowed with human-like intelligence. These issues have been explored by myth, fiction and philosophy since antiquity.[20] Some people also consider AI to be a danger to humanity if it progresses unabated.[21][22] Others believe that AI, unlike previous technological revolutions, will create a risk of mass unemployment.[23]\n",
      "\n",
      "In the twenty-first century, AI techniques have experienced a resurgence following concurrent advances in computer power, large amounts of data, and theoretical understanding; and AI techniques have become an essential part of the technology industry, helping to solve many challenging problems in computer science, software engineering and operations research.[24][12]\n",
      "\n",
      "Thought-capable artificial beings appeared as storytelling devices in antiquity,[25] and have been common in fiction, as in Mary Shelley's Frankenstein or Karel Čapek's R.U.R. (Rossum's Universal Robots).[26] These characters and their fates raised many of the same issues now discussed in the ethics of artificial intelligence.[20]\n",
      "\n",
      "The study of mechanical or \"formal\" reasoning began with philosophers and mathematicians in antiquity. The study of mathematical logic led directly to Alan Turing's theory of computation, which suggested that a machine, by shuffling symbols as simple as \"0\" and \"1\", could simulate any conceivable act of mathematical deduction. This insight, that digital computers can simulate any process of formal reasoning, is known as the Church–Turing thesis.[27] Along with concurrent discoveries in neurobiology, information theory and cybernetics, this led researchers to consider the possibility of building an electronic brain. Turing proposed changing the question from whether a machine was intelligent, to \"whether or not it is possible for machinery to show intelligent behaviour\".[28] The first work that is now generally recognized as AI was McCullouch and Pitts' 1943 formal design for Turing-complete \"artificial neurons\".[29]\n",
      "\n",
      "The field of AI research was born at a workshop at Dartmouth College in 1956,[30] where the term \"Artificial Intelligence\" was coined by John McCarthy to distinguish the field from cybernetics and escape the influence of the cyberneticist Norbert Wiener.[31] Attendees Allen Newell (CMU), Herbert Simon (CMU), John McCarthy (MIT), Marvin Minsky (MIT) and Arthur Samuel (IBM) became the founders and leaders of AI research.[32] They and their students produced programs that the press described as \"astonishing\":[33] computers were learning checkers strategies (c. 1954)[34] (and by 1959 were reportedly playing better than the average human),[35] solving word problems in algebra, proving logical theorems (Logic Theorist, first run c. 1956) and speaking English.[36] By the middle of the 1960s, research in the U.S. was heavily funded by the Department of Defense[37] and laboratories had been established around the world.[38] AI's founders were optimistic about the future: Herbert Simon predicted, \"machines will be capable, within twenty years, of doing any work a man can do\". Marvin Minsky agreed, writing, \"within a generation ... the problem of creating 'artificial intelligence' will substantially be solved\".[8]\n",
      "\n",
      "They failed to recognize the difficulty of some of the remaining tasks. Progress slowed and in 1974, in response to the criticism of Sir James Lighthill[39] and ongoing pressure from the US Congress to fund more productive projects, both the U.S. and British governments cut off exploratory research in AI. The next few years would later be called an \"AI winter\",[10] a period when obtaining funding for AI projects was difficult.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the early 1980s, AI research was revived by the commercial success of expert systems,[40] a form of AI program that simulated the knowledge and analytical skills of human experts. By 1985, the market for AI had reached over a billion dollars. At the same time, Japan's fifth generation computer project inspired the U.S and British governments to restore funding for academic research.[9] However, beginning with the collapse of the Lisp Machine market in 1987, AI once again fell into disrepute, and a second, longer-lasting hiatus began.[11]\n",
      "\n",
      "In the late 1990s and early 21st century, AI began to be used for logistics, data mining, medical diagnosis and other areas.[24] The success was due to increasing computational power (see Moore's law), greater emphasis on solving specific problems, new ties between AI and other fields (such as statistics, economics and mathematics), and a commitment by researchers to mathematical methods and scientific standards.[41] Deep Blue became the first computer chess-playing system to beat a reigning world chess champion, Garry Kasparov, on 11 May 1997.[42]\n",
      "\n",
      "In 2011, a Jeopardy! quiz show exhibition match, IBM's question answering system, Watson, defeated the two greatest Jeopardy! champions, Brad Rutter and Ken Jennings, by a significant margin.[43] Faster computers, algorithmic improvements, and access to large amounts of data enabled advances in machine learning and perception; data-hungry deep learning methods started to dominate accuracy benchmarks around 2012.[44] The Kinect, which provides a 3D body–motion interface for the Xbox 360 and the Xbox One, uses algorithms that emerged from lengthy AI research[45] as do intelligent personal assistants in smartphones.[46] In March 2016, AlphaGo won 4 out of 5 games of Go in a match with Go champion Lee Sedol, becoming the first computer Go-playing system to beat a professional Go player without handicaps.[7][47] In the 2017 Future of Go Summit, AlphaGo won a three-game match with Ke Jie,[48] who at the time continuously held the world No. 1 ranking for two years.[49][50] This marked the completion of a significant milestone in the development of Artificial Intelligence as Go is a relatively complex game, more so than Chess.\n",
      "\n",
      "According to Bloomberg's Jack Clark, 2015 was a landmark year for artificial intelligence, with the number of software projects that use AI Google increased from a \"sporadic usage\" in 2012 to more than 2,700 projects. Clark also presents factual data indicating the improvements of AI since 2012 supported by lower error rates in image processing tasks.[51] He attributes this to an increase in affordable neural networks, due to a rise in cloud computing infrastructure and to an increase in research tools and datasets.[12] Other cited examples include Microsoft's development of a Skype system that can automatically translate from one language to another and Facebook's system that can describe images to blind people.[51] In a 2017 survey, one in five companies reported they had \"incorporated AI in some offerings or processes\".[52][53] Around 2016, China greatly accelerated its government funding; given its large supply of data and its rapidly increasing research output, some observers believe it may be on track to becoming an \"AI superpower\".[54][55] However, it has been acknowledged that reports regarding artificial intelligence have tended to be exaggerated.[56][57][58]\n",
      "\n",
      "Computer science defines AI research as the study of \"intelligent agents\": any device that perceives its environment and takes actions that maximize its chance of successfully achieving its goals.[1] A more elaborate definition characterizes AI as “a system’s ability to correctly interpret external data, to learn from such data, and to use those learnings to achieve specific goals and tasks through flexible adaptation.”[59]\n",
      "\n",
      "A typical AI analyzes its environment and takes actions that maximize its chance of success.[1] An AI's intended utility function (or goal) can be simple (\"1 if the AI wins a game of Go, 0 otherwise\") or complex (\"Do mathematically similar actions to the ones succeeded in the past\"). Goals can be explicitly defined or induced. If the AI is programmed for \"reinforcement learning\", goals can be implicitly induced by rewarding some types of behavior or punishing others.[a] Alternatively, an evolutionary system can induce goals by using a \"fitness function\" to mutate and preferentially replicate high-scoring AI systems, similar to how animals evolved to innately desire certain goals such as finding food.[60] Some AI systems, such as nearest-neighbor, instead of reason by analogy, these systems are not generally given goals, except to the degree that goals are implicit in their training data.[61] Such systems can still be benchmarked if the non-goal system is framed as a system whose \"goal\" is to successfully accomplish its narrow classification task.[62]\n",

      "AI often revolves around the use of algorithms. An algorithm is a set of unambiguous instructions that a mechanical computer can execute.[b] A complex algorithm is often built on top of other, simpler, algorithms. A simple example of an algorithm is the following (optimal for first player) recipe for play at tic-tac-toe:[63]\n",
      "\n",
      "Many AI algorithms are capable of learning from data; they can enhance themselves by learning new heuristics (strategies, or \"rules of thumb\", that have worked well in the past), or can themselves write other algorithms. Some of the \"learners\" described below, including Bayesian networks, decision trees, and nearest-neighbor, could theoretically, (given infinite data, time, and memory) learn to approximate any function, including which combination of mathematical functions would best describe the world[citation needed]. These learners could therefore, derive all possible knowledge, by considering every possible hypothesis and matching them against the data. In practice, it is almost never possible to consider every possibility, because of the phenomenon of \"combinatorial explosion\", where the amount of time needed to solve a problem grows exponentially. Much of AI research involves figuring out how to identify and avoid considering broad range of possibilities that are unlikely to be beneficial.[64][65] For example, when viewing a map and looking for the shortest driving route from Denver to New York in the East, one can in most cases skip looking at any path through San Francisco or other areas far to the West; thus, an AI wielding a pathfinding algorithm like A* can avoid the combinatorial explosion that would ensue if every possible route had to be ponderously considered in turn.[66]\n",
      "\n",
      "The earliest (and easiest to understand) approach to AI was symbolism (such as formal logic): \"If an otherwise healthy adult has a fever, then they may have influenza\". A second, more general, approach is Bayesian inference: \"If the current patient has a fever, adjust the probability they have influenza in such-and-such way\". The third major approach, extremely popular in routine business AI applications, are analogizers such as SVM and nearest-neighbor: \"After examining the records of known past patients whose temperature, symptoms, age, and other factors mostly match the current patient, X% of those patients turned out to have influenza\". A fourth approach is harder to intuitively understand, but is inspired by how the brain's machinery works: the artificial neural network approach uses artificial \"neurons\" that can learn by comparing itself to the desired output and altering the strengths of the connections between its internal neurons to \"reinforce\" connections that seemed to be useful. These four main approaches can overlap with each other and with evolutionary systems; for example, neural nets can learn to make inferences, to generalize, and to make analogies. Some systems implicitly or explicitly use multiple of these approaches, alongside many other AI and non-AI algorithms; the best approach is often different depending on the problem.[67][68]\n",
      "\n",
      "Learning algorithms work on the basis that strategies, algorithms, and inferences that worked well in the past are likely to continue working well in the future. These inferences can be obvious, such as \"since the sun rose every morning for the last 10,000 days, it will probably rise tomorrow morning as well\". They can be nuanced, such as \"X% of families have geographically separate species with color variants, so there is a Y% chance that undiscovered black swans exist\". Learners also work on the basis of \"Occam's razor\": The simplest theory that explains the data is the likeliest. Therefore, according to Occam's razor principle, a learner must be designed such that it prefers simpler theories to complex theories, except in cases where the complex theory is proven substantially better.\n",
      "\n",
      "Settling on a bad, overly complex theory gerrymandered to fit all the past training data is known as overfitting. Many systems attempt to reduce overfitting by rewarding a theory in accordance with how well it fits the data, but penalizing the theory in accordance with how complex the theory is.[69] Besides classic overfitting, learners can also disappoint by \"learning the wrong lesson\". A toy example is that an image classifier trained only on pictures of brown horses and black cats might conclude that all brown patches are likely to be horses.[70] A real-world example is that, unlike humans, current image classifiers don't determine the spatial relationship between components of the picture; instead, they learn abstract patterns of pixels that humans are oblivious to, but that linearly correlate with images of certain types of real objects. Faintly superimposing such a pattern on a legitimate image results in an \"adversarial\" image that the system misclassifies.[c][71][72][73]\n",

      "Compared with humans, existing AI lacks several features of human \"commonsense reasoning\"; most notably, humans have powerful mechanisms for reasoning about \"naïve physics\" such as space, time, and physical interactions. This enables even young children to easily make inferences like \"If I roll this pen off a table, it will fall on the floor\". Humans also have a powerful mechanism of \"folk psychology\" that helps them to interpret natural-language sentences such as \"The city councilmen refused the demonstrators a permit because they advocated violence\". (A generic AI has difficulty discerning whether the ones alleged to be advocating violence are the councilmen or the demonstrators.)[76][77][78] This lack of \"common knowledge\" means that AI often makes different mistakes than humans make, in ways that can seem incomprehensible. For example, existing self-driving cars cannot reason about the location nor the intentions of pedestrians in the exact way that humans do, and instead must use non-human modes of reasoning to avoid accidents.[79][80][81]\n",

      "The cognitive capabilities of current architectures are very limited, using only a simplified version of what intelligence is really capable of. For instance, the human mind has come up with ways to reason beyond measure and logical explanations to different occurrences in life. What would have been otherwise straightforward, an equivalently difficult problem may be challenging to solve computationally as opposed to using the human mind. This gives rise to two classes of models: structuralist and functionalist. The structural models aim to loosely mimic the basic intelligence operations of the mind such as reasoning and logic. The functional model refers to the correlating data to its computed counterpart.[82]\n",

      "Knowledge representation[86] and knowledge engineering[87] are central to classical AI research. Some \"expert systems\" attempt to gather together explicit knowledge possessed by experts in some narrow domain. In addition, some projects attempt to gather the \"commonsense knowledge\" known to the average person into a database containing extensive knowledge about the world. Among the things a comprehensive commonsense knowledge base would contain are: objects, properties, categories and relations between objects;[88] situations, events, states and time;[89] causes and effects;[90] knowledge about knowledge (what we know about what other people know);[91] and many other, less well researched domains. A representation of \"what exists\" is an ontology: the set of objects, relations, concepts, and properties formally described so that software agents can interpret them. The semantics of these are captured as description logic concepts, roles, and individuals, and typically implemented as classes, properties, and individuals in the Web Ontology Language.[92] The most general ontologies are called upper ontologies, which attempt to provide a foundation for all other knowledge[93] by acting as mediators between domain ontologies that cover specific knowledge about a particular knowledge domain (field of interest or area of concern). Such formal knowledge representations can be used in content-based indexing and retrieval,[94] scene interpretation,[95] clinical decision support,[96] knowledge discovery (mining \"interesting\" and actionable inferences from large databases),[97] and other areas.[98]\n",

      "In classical planning problems, the agent can assume that it is the only system acting in the world, allowing the agent to be certain of the consequences of its actions.[107] However, if the agent is not the only actor, then it requires that the agent can reason under uncertainty. This calls for an agent that can not only assess its environment and make predictions, but also evaluate its predictions and adapt based on its assessment.[108]\n",

      "Unsupervised learning is the ability to find patterns in a stream of input, without requiring a human to label the inputs first. Supervised learning includes both classification and numerical regression, which requires a human to label the input data first. Classification is used to determine what category something belongs in, and occurs after a program sees a number of examples of things from several categories. Regression is the attempt to produce a function that describes the relationship between inputs and outputs and predicts how the outputs should change as the inputs change.[112] Both classifiers and regression learners can be viewed as \"function approximators\" trying to learn an unknown (possibly implicit) function; for example, a spam classifier can be viewed as learning a function that maps from the text of an email to one of two categories, \"spam\" or \"not spam\". Computational learning theory can assess learners by computational complexity, by sample complexity (how much data is required), or by other notions of optimization.[113] In reinforcement learning[114] the agent is rewarded for good responses and punished for bad ones. The agent uses this sequence of rewards and punishments to form a strategy for operating in its problem space.\n",

      "Natural language processing[115] (NLP) gives machines the ability to read and understand human language. A sufficiently powerful natural language processing system would enable natural-language user interfaces and the acquisition of knowledge directly from human-written sources, such as newswire texts. Some straightforward applications of natural language processing include information retrieval, text mining, question answering[116] and machine translation.[117] Many current approaches use word co-occurrence frequencies to construct syntactic representations of text. \"Keyword spotting\" strategies for search are popular and scalable but dumb; a search query for \"dog\" might only match documents with the literal word \"dog\" and miss a document with the word \"poodle\". \"Lexical affinity\" strategies use the occurrence of words such as \"accident\" to assess the sentiment of a document. Modern statistical NLP approaches can combine all these strategies as well as others, and often achieve acceptable accuracy at the page or paragraph level, but continue to lack the semantic understanding required to classify isolated sentences well. Besides the usual difficulties with encoding semantic commonsense knowledge, existing semantic NLP sometimes scales too poorly to be viable in business applications. Beyond semantic NLP, the ultimate goal of \"narrative\" NLP is to embody a full understanding of commonsense reasoning.[118]\n",

Applications include speech recognition,[120] facial recognition, and object recognition.[121] Computer vision is the ability to analyze visual input. Such input is usually ambiguous; a giant, fifty-meter-tall pedestrian far away may produce exactly the same pixels as a nearby normal-sized pedestrian, requiring the AI to judge the relative likelihood and reasonableness of different interpretations, for example by using its \"object model\" to assess that fifty-meter pedestrians do not exist.[122]\n",

      "AI is heavily used in robotics.[123] Advanced robotic arms and other industrial robots, widely used in modern factories, can learn from experience how to move efficiently despite the presence of friction and gear slippage.[124] A modern mobile robot, when given a small, static, and visible environment, can easily determine its location and map its environment; however, dynamic environments, such as (in endoscopy) the interior of a patient's breathing body, pose a greater challenge. Motion planning is the process of breaking down a movement task into \"primitives\" such as individual joint movements. Such movement often involves compliant motion, a process where movement requires maintaining physical contact with an object.[125][126][127] Moravec's paradox generalizes that low-level sensorimotor skills that humans take for granted are, counterintuitively, difficult to program into a robot; the paradox is named after Hans Moravec, who stated in 1988 that \"it is comparatively easy to make computers exhibit adult level performance on intelligence tests or playing checkers, and difficult or impossible to give them the skills of a one-year-old when it comes to perception and mobility\".[128][129] This is attributed to the fact that, unlike checkers, physical dexterity has been a direct target of natural selection for millions of years.[130]\n",

      "Moravec's paradox can be extended to many forms of social intelligence.[132][133] Distributed multi-agent coordination of autonomous vehicles remains a difficult problem.[134] Affective computing is an interdisciplinary umbrella that comprises systems which recognize, interpret, process, or simulate human affects.[135][136][137] Moderate successes related to affective computing include textual sentiment analysis and, more recently, multimodal affect analysis (see multimodal sentiment analysis), wherein AI classifies the affects displayed by a videotaped subject.[138]\n",

      "In the long run, social skills and an understanding of human emotion and game theory would be valuable to a social agent. Being able to predict the actions of others by understanding their motives and emotional states would allow an agent to make better decisions. Some computer systems mimic human emotion and expressions to appear more sensitive to the emotional dynamics of human interaction, or to otherwise facilitate human–computer interaction.[139] Similarly, some virtual assistants are programmed to speak conversationally or even to banter humorously; this tends to give naïve users an unrealistic conception of how intelligent existing computer agents actually are.[140]\n",

      "Historically, projects such as the Cyc knowledge base (1984–) and the massive Japanese Fifth Generation Computer Systems initiative (1982–1992) attempted to cover the breadth of human cognition. These early projects failed to escape the limitations of non-quantitative symbolic logic models and, in retrospect, greatly underestimated the difficulty of cross-domain AI. Nowadays, the vast majority of current AI researchers work instead on tractable \"narrow AI\" applications (such as medical diagnosis or automobile navigation).[141] Many researchers predict that such \"narrow AI\" work in different individual domains will eventually be incorporated into a machine with artificial general intelligence (AGI), combining most of the narrow skills mentioned in this article and at some point even exceeding human ability in most or all these areas.[18][142] Many advances have general, cross-domain significance. One high-profile example is that DeepMind in the 2010s developed a \"generalized artificial intelligence\" that could learn many diverse Atari games on its own, and later developed a variant of the system which succeeds at sequential learning.[143][144][145] Besides transfer learning,[146] hypothetical AGI breakthroughs could include the development of reflective architectures that can engage in decision-theoretic metareasoning, and figuring out how to \"slurp up\" a comprehensive knowledge base from the entire unstructured Web.[6] Some argue that some kind of (currently-undiscovered) conceptually straightforward, but mathematically difficult, \"Master Algorithm\" could lead to AGI.[147] Finally, a few \"emergent\" approaches look to simulating human intelligence extremely closely, and believe that anthropomorphic features like an artificial brain or simulated child development may someday reach a critical point where general intelligence emerges.[148][149]\n",

A problem like machine translation is considered \"AI-complete\", because all of these problems need to be solved simultaneously in order to reach human-level machine performance.\n",

Many of these researchers gathered for meetings of the Teleological Society at Princeton University and the Ratio Club in England.[151] By 1960, this approach was largely abandoned, although elements of it would be revived in the 1980s.\n",

John Haugeland named these symbolic approaches to AI \"good old fashioned AI\" or \"GOFAI\".[152] During the 1960s, symbolic approaches had achieved great success at simulating high-level \"thinking\" in small demonstration programs. Approaches based on cybernetics or artificial neural networks were abandoned or pushed into the background.[153]\n",

Roger Schank described their \"anti-logic\" approaches as \"scruffy\" (as opposed to the \"neat\" paradigms at CMU and Stanford).[16] Commonsense knowledge bases (such as Doug Lenat's Cyc) are an example of \"scruffy\" AI, since they must be built by hand, one complicated concept at a time.[159]\n",

      "Much of traditional GOFAI got bogged down on ad hoc patches to symbolic computation that worked on their own toy models but failed to generalize to real-world results. However, around the 1990s, AI researchers adopted sophisticated mathematical tools, such as hidden Markov models (HMM), information theory, and normative Bayesian decision theory to compare or to unify competing architectures. The shared mathematical language permitted a high level of collaboration with more established fields (like mathematics, economics or operations research).[d] Compared with GOFAI, new \"statistical learning\" techniques such as HMM and neural networks were gaining higher levels of accuracy in many practical domains such as data mining, without necessarily acquiring a semantic understanding of the datasets. The increased successes with real-world data led to increasing emphasis on comparing different approaches against shared test data to see which approach performed best in a broader context than that provided by idiosyncratic toy models; AI research was becoming more scientific. Nowadays results of experiments are often rigorously measurable, and are sometimes (with difficulty) reproducible.[41][169] Different statistical learning techniques have different limitations; for example, basic HMM cannot model the infinite possible combinations of natural language.[170] Critics note that the shift from GOFAI to statistical learning is often also a shift away from explainable AI.

In some search methodologies heuristics can also serve to entirely eliminate some choices that are unlikely to lead to a goal (called \"pruning the search tree\"). Heuristics supply the program with a \"best guess\" for the path on which the solution lies.[183] Heuristics limit the search for solutions into a smaller sample size.[125]\n",

For many problems, it is possible to begin the search with some form of a guess and then refine the guess incrementally until no more refinements can be made. These algorithms can be visualized as blind hill climbing: we begin the search at a random point on the landscape, and then, by jumps or steps, we keep moving our guess uphill, until we reach the top. Other optimization algorithms are simulated annealing, beam search and random optimization.[184]\n",

Fuzzy set theory assigns a \"degree of truth\" (between 0 and 1) to vague statements such as \"Alice is old\" (or rich, or tall, or hungry) that are too linguistically imprecise to be completely true or false. Fuzzy logic is successfully used in control systems to allow experts to contribute vague rules such as \"if you are close to the destination station and moving fast, increase the train's brake pressure\"; these vague rules can then be numerically refined within the system.

For inference to be tractable, most observations must be conditionally independent of one another. Complicated graphs with diamonds or other \"loops\" (undirected cycles) can require a sophisticated method such as Markov chain Monte Carlo, which spreads an ensemble of random walkers throughout the Bayesian network and attempts to converge to an assessment of the conditional probabilities.

These examples are known as observations or patterns. In supervised learning, each pattern belongs to a certain predefined class. A class can be seen as a decision that has to be made. All the observations combined with their class labels are known as a data set. When a new observation is received, that observation is classified based on previous experience.[208]\n",

Model-based classifiers perform well if the assumed model is an extremely good fit for the actual data. Otherwise, if no matching model is available, and if accuracy (rather than speed or scalability) is the sole concern, conventional wisdom is that discriminative classifiers (especially SVM) tend to be more accurate than model-based classifiers such as \"naive Bayes\" on most practical data sets.[219][220]\n",

      "Neural networks were inspired by the architecture of neurons in the human brain. A simple \"neuron\" N accepts input from other neurons, each of which, when activated (or \"fired\"), cast a weighted \"vote\" for or against whether neuron N should itself activate. Learning requires an algorithm to adjust these weights based on the training data; one simple algorithm (dubbed \"fire together, wire together\") is to increase the weight between two connected neurons when the activation of one triggers the successful activation of another. The neural network forms \"concepts\" that are distributed among a subnetwork of shared[j] neurons that tend to fire together; a concept meaning \"leg\" might be coupled with a subnetwork meaning \"foot\" that includes the sound for \"foot\". Neurons have a continuous spectrum of activation; in addition, neurons can process inputs in a nonlinear way rather than weighing straightforward votes. Modern neural networks can learn both continuous functions and, surprisingly, digital logical operations. Neural networks' early successes included predicting the stock market and (in 1995) a mostly self-driving car.[k][221] In the 2010s, advances in neural networks using deep learning thrust AI into widespread public consciousness and contributed to an enormous upshift in corporate AI spending; for example, AI-related M&A in 2017 was over 25 times as large as in 2015.[222][223]\n",

For example, a feedforward network with six hidden layers can learn a seven-link causal chain (six hidden layers + output layer) and has a \"credit assignment path\" (CAP) depth of seven[citation needed]. Many deep learning systems need to be able to learn chains ten or more causal links in length.[233] Deep learning has transformed many important subfields of artificial intelligence[why?], including computer vision, speech recognition, natural language processing and others.[234][235][233]\n",

Ivakhnenko's 1971 paper[240] describes the learning of a deep feedforward multilayer perceptron with eight layers, already much deeper than many later networks. In 2006, a publication by Geoffrey Hinton and Ruslan Salakhutdinov introduced another way of pre-training many-layered feedforward neural networks (FNNs) one layer at a time, treating each layer in turn as an unsupervised restricted Boltzmann machine, then using supervised backpropagation for fine-tuning.[241] Similar to shallow artificial neural networks, deep neural networks can model complex non-linear relationships.

As the name implies, this helps to determine that a user is an actual person and not a computer posing as a human. In contrast to the standard Turing test, CAPTCHA is administered by a machine and targeted to a human as opposed to being administered by a human and targeted to a machine.

While automation eliminates old jobs, it also creates new jobs through micro-economic and macro-economic effects.[368] Unlike previous waves of automation, many middle-class jobs may be eliminated by artificial intelligence; The Economist states that \"the worry that AI could do to white-collar jobs what steam power did to blue-collar ones during the Industrial Revolution\" is \"worth taking seriously\".[369] Subjective estimates of the risk vary widely; for example, Michael Osborne and Carl Benedikt Frey estimate 47% of U.S. jobs are at \"high risk\" of potential automation, while an OECD report classifies only 9% of U.S. jobs as \"high risk\".[370][371][372] Jobs at extreme risk range from paralegals to fast food cooks, while job demand is likely to increase for care-related professions ranging from personal healthcare to the clergy.[373] Author Martin Ford and others go further and argue that many jobs are routine, repetitive and (to an AI) predictable; Ford warns that these jobs may be automated in the next couple of decades, and that many of the new jobs may not be \"accessible to people with average capability\", even with retraining. Economists point out that in the past technology has tended to increase rather than reduce total employment, but acknowledge that \"we're in uncharted territory\" with AI.[23]\n",

      "The field of machine ethics is concerned with giving machines ethical principles, or a procedure for discovering a way to resolve the ethical dilemmas they might encounter, enabling them to function in an ethically responsible manner through their own ethical decision making.[380] The field was delineated in the AAAI Fall 2005 Symposium on Machine Ethics: \"Past research concerning the relationship between technology and ethics has largely focused on responsible and irresponsible use of technology by human beings, with a few people being interested in how human beings ought to treat machines. In all cases, only human beings have engaged in ethical reasoning. The time has come for adding an ethical dimension to at least some machines. Recognition of the ethical ramifications of behavior involving machines, as well as recent and potential developments in machine autonomy, necessitate this. In contrast to computer hacking, software property issues, privacy issues and other topics normally ascribed to computer ethics, machine ethics is concerned with the behavior of machines towards human users and other machines. Research in machine ethics is key to alleviating concerns with autonomous systems—it could be argued that the notion of autonomous machines without such a dimension is at the root of all fear concerning machine intelligence. Further, investigation of machine ethics could enable the discovery of problems with current ethical theories, advancing our thinking about Ethics.\"[381] Machine ethics is sometimes referred to as machine morality, computational ethics or computational morality. A variety of perspectives of this nascent field can be found in the collected edition \"Machine Ethics\"[380] that stems from the AAAI Fall 2005 Symposium on Machine Ethics.[381]\n",

Rubin believes that AI can be neither designed nor guaranteed to be benevolent.[382] He argues that \"any sufficiently advanced benevolence may be indistinguishable from malevolence.\" Humans should not assume machines or robots would treat us favorably because there is no a priori reason to believe that they would be sympathetic to our system of morality, which has evolved along with our particular biology (which AIs would not share). Hyper-intelligent software may not necessarily decide to support the continued existence of humanity and would be extremely difficult to stop. This topic has also recently begun to be discussed in academic publications as a real source of risks to civilization, humans, and planet Earth.\n",

The hard problem is that people also know something else—they also know what red looks like. (Consider that a person born blind can know that something is red without knowing what red looks like.)[l] Everyone knows subjective experience exists, because they do it every day (e.g., all sighted people know what red looks like).

They and their students produced programs that the press described as \"astonishing\": computers were learning checkers strategies (c. 1954) (and by 1959 were reportedly playing better than the average human), solving word problems in algebra, proving logical theorems (Logic Theorist, first run c. 1956) and speaking English. By the middle of the 1960s, research in the U.S. was heavily funded by the Department of Defense and laboratories had been established around the world.

An AI\\'s intended utility function (or goal) can be simple (\"1 if the AI wins a game of Go, 0 otherwise\") or complex (\"Do mathematically similar actions to the ones succeeded in the past\"). Goals can be explicitly defined or induced. If the AI is programmed for \"reinforcement learning\", goals can be implicitly induced by rewarding some types of behavior or punishing others.[a] Alternatively, an evolutionary system can induce goals by using a \"fitness function\" to mutate and preferentially replicate high-scoring AI systems, similar to how animals evolved to innately desire certain goals such as finding food. Some AI systems, such as nearest-neighbor, instead of reason by analogy, these systems are not generally given goals, except to the degree that goals are implicit in their training data. Such systems can still be benchmarked if the non-goal system is framed as a system whose \"goal\" is to successfully accomplish its narrow classification task.\\n',\n",
       " 'AI often revolves around the use of algorithms. An algorithm is a set of unambiguous instructions that a mechanical computer can execute.[b] A complex algorithm is often built on top of other, simpler, algorithms. A simple example of an algorithm is the following (optimal for first player) recipe for play at tic-tac-toe:\\n',\n",
       " 'Many AI algorithms are capable of learning from data; they can enhance themselves by learning new heuristics (strategies, or \"rules of thumb\", that have worked well in the past), or can themselves write other algorithms. Some of the \"learners\" described below, including Bayesian networks, decision trees, and nearest-neighbor, could theoretically, (given infinite data, time, and memory) learn to approximate any function, including which combination of mathematical functions would best describe the world[citation needed]. These learners could therefore, derive all possible knowledge, by considering every possible hypothesis and matching them against the data. In practice, it is almost never possible to consider every possibility, because of the phenomenon of \"combinatorial explosion\", where the amount of time needed to solve a problem grows exponentially. Much of AI research involves figuring out how to identify and avoid considering broad range of possibilities that are unlikely to be beneficial. For example, when viewing a map and looking for the shortest driving route from Denver to New York in the East, one can in most cases skip looking at any path through San Francisco or other areas far to the West; thus, an AI wielding a pathfinding algorithm like A* can avoid the combinatorial explosion that would ensue if every possible route had to be ponderously considered in turn.\\n',\n",
       " 'The earliest (and easiest to understand) approach to AI was symbolism (such as formal logic): \"If an otherwise healthy adult has a fever, then they may have influenza\". A second, more general, approach is Bayesian inference: \"If the current patient has a fever, adjust the probability they have influenza in such-and-such way\". The third major approach, extremely popular in routine business AI applications, are analogizers such as SVM and nearest-neighbor: \"After examining the records of known past patients whose temperature, symptoms, age, and other factors mostly match the current patient, X% of those patients turned out to have influenza\". A fourth approach is harder to intuitively understand, but is inspired by how the brain\\'s machinery works: the artificial neural network approach uses artificial \"neurons\" that can learn by comparing itself to the desired output and altering the strengths of the connections between its internal neurons to \"reinforce\" connections that seemed to be useful. These four main approaches can overlap with each other and with evolutionary systems; for example, neural nets can learn to make inferences, to generalize, and to make analogies. Some systems implicitly or explicitly use multiple of these approaches, alongside many other AI and non-AI algorithms; the best approach is often different depending on the problem.\\n',\n",
       " 'Learning algorithms work on the basis that strategies, algorithms, and inferences that worked well in the past are likely to continue working well in the future. These inferences can be obvious, such as \"since the sun rose every morning for the last 10,000 days, it will probably rise tomorrow morning as well\". They can be nuanced, such as \"X% of families have geographically separate species with color variants, so there is a Y% chance that undiscovered black swans exist\". Learners also work on the basis of \"Occam\\'s razor\": The simplest theory that explains the data is the likeliest. Therefore, according to Occam\\'s razor principle, a learner must be designed such that it prefers simpler theories to complex theories, except in cases where the complex theory is proven substantially better.\\n',\n",
       " 'Settling on a bad, overly complex theory gerrymandered to fit all the past training data is known as overfitting. Many systems attempt to reduce overfitting by rewarding a theory in accordance with how well it fits the data, but penalizing the theory in accordance with how complex the theory is. Besides classic overfitting, learners can also disappoint by \"learning the wrong lesson\". A toy example is that an image classifier trained only on pictures of brown horses and black cats might conclude that all brown patches are likely to be horses. A real-world example is that, unlike humans, current image classifiers don\\'t determine the spatial relationship between components of the picture; instead, they learn abstract patterns of pixels that humans are oblivious to, but that linearly correlate with images of certain types of real objects. Faintly superimposing such a pattern on a legitimate image results in an \"adversarial\" image that the system misclassifies.[c]\\n',\n",
       " 'Compared with humans, existing AI lacks several features of human \"commonsense reasoning\"; most notably, humans have powerful mechanisms for reasoning about \"naïve physics\" such as space, time, and physical interactions. This enables even young children to easily make inferences like \"If I roll this pen off a table, it will fall on the floor\". Humans also have a powerful mechanism of \"folk psychology\" that helps them to interpret natural-language sentences such as \"The city councilmen refused the demonstrators a permit because they advocated violence\". (A generic AI has difficulty discerning whether the ones alleged to be advocating violence are the councilmen or the demonstrators.) This lack of \"common knowledge\" means that AI often makes different mistakes than humans make, in ways that can seem incomprehensible. For example, existing self-driving cars cannot reason about the location nor the intentions of pedestrians in the exact way that humans do, and instead must use non-human modes of reasoning to avoid accidents.\\n',\n",
       " 'The cognitive capabilities of current architectures are very limited, using only a simplified version of what intelligence is really capable of. For instance, the human mind has come up with ways to reason beyond measure and logical explanations to different occurrences in life. What would have been otherwise straightforward, an equivalently difficult problem may be challenging to solve computationally as opposed to using the human mind. This gives rise to two classes of models: structuralist and functionalist. The structural models aim to loosely mimic the basic intelligence operations of the mind such as reasoning and logic. The functional model refers to the correlating data to its computed counterpart.\\n',\n",

       " 'These algorithms proved to be insufficient for solving large reasoning problems, because they experienced a \"combinatorial explosion\": they became exponentially slower as the problems grew larger.

       " 'Knowledge representation and knowledge engineering are central to classical AI research. Some \"expert systems\" attempt to gather together explicit knowledge possessed by experts in some narrow domain. In addition, some projects attempt to gather the \"commonsense knowledge\" known to the average person into a database containing extensive knowledge about the world. Among the things a comprehensive commonsense knowledge base would contain are: objects, properties, categories and relations between objects; situations, events, states and time; causes and effects; knowledge about knowledge (what we know about what other people know); and many other, less well researched domains. A representation of \"what exists\" is an ontology: the set of objects, relations, concepts, and properties formally described so that software agents can interpret them. The semantics of these are captured as description logic concepts, roles, and individuals, and typically implemented as classes, properties, and individuals in the Web Ontology Language. The most general ontologies are called upper ontologies, which attempt to provide a foundation for all other knowledge by acting as mediators between domain ontologies that cover specific knowledge about a particular knowledge domain (field of interest or area of concern). Such formal knowledge representations can be used in content-based indexing and retrieval, scene interpretation, clinical decision support, knowledge discovery (mining \"interesting\" and actionable inferences from large databases), and other areas.\\n',\n",
       " 'Among the most difficult problems in knowledge representation are:\\n',\n",
       " 'Intelligent agents must be able to set goals and achieve them. They need a way to visualize the future—a representation of the state of the world and be able to make predictions about how their actions will change it—and be able to make choices that maximize the utility (or \"value\") of available choices.\\n',\n",
       " 'In classical planning problems, the agent can assume that it is the only system acting in the world, allowing the agent to be certain of the consequences of its actions. However, if the agent is not the only actor, then it requires that the agent can reason under uncertainty. This calls for an agent that can not only assess its environment and make predictions, but also evaluate its predictions and adapt based on its assessment.\\n',\n",
       " 'Multi-agent planning uses the cooperation and competition of many agents to achieve a given goal. Emergent behavior such as this is used by evolutionary algorithms and swarm intelligence.\\n',\n",
       " \"Machine learning (ML), a fundamental concept of AI research since the field's inception, is the study of computer algorithms that improve automatically through experience.\\n\",\n",
       " 'Unsupervised learning is the ability to find patterns in a stream of input, without requiring a human to label the inputs first. Supervised learning includes both classification and numerical regression, which requires a human to label the input data first. Classification is used to determine what category something belongs in, and occurs after a program sees a number of examples of things from several categories. Regression is the attempt to produce a function that describes the relationship between inputs and outputs and predicts how the outputs should change as the inputs change. Both classifiers and regression learners can be viewed as \"function approximators\" trying to learn an unknown (possibly implicit) function; for example, a spam classifier can be viewed as learning a function that maps from the text of an email to one of two categories, \"spam\" or \"not spam\". Computational learning theory can assess learners by computational complexity, by sample complexity (how much data is required), or by other notions of optimization. In reinforcement learning the agent is rewarded for good responses and punished for bad ones. The agent uses this sequence of rewards and punishments to form a strategy for operating in its problem space.\\n',\n",
       " 'Natural language processing (NLP) gives machines the ability to read and understand human language. A sufficiently powerful natural language processing system would enable natural-language user interfaces and the acquisition of knowledge directly from human-written sources, such as newswire texts. Some straightforward applications of natural language processing include information retrieval, text mining, question answering and machine translation. Many current approaches use word co-occurrence frequencies to construct syntactic representations of text. \"Keyword spotting\" strategies for search are popular and scalable but dumb; a search query for \"dog\" might only match documents with the literal word \"dog\" and miss a document with the word \"poodle\". \"Lexical affinity\" strategies use the occurrence of words such as \"accident\" to assess the sentiment of a document. Modern statistical NLP approaches can combine all these strategies as well as others, and often achieve acceptable accuracy at the page or paragraph level, but continue to lack the semantic understanding required to classify isolated sentences well. Besides the usual difficulties with encoding semantic commonsense knowledge, existing semantic NLP sometimes scales too poorly to be viable in business applications. Beyond semantic NLP, the ultimate goal of \"narrative\" NLP is to embody a full understanding of commonsense reasoning.\\n',\n",
       " 'Machine perception is the ability to use input from sensors (such as cameras (visible spectrum or infrared), microphones, wireless signals, and active lidar, sonar, radar, and tactile sensors) to deduce aspects of the world. Applications include speech recognition, facial recognition, and object recognition. Computer vision is the ability to analyze visual input. Such input is usually ambiguous; a giant, fifty-meter-tall pedestrian far away may produce exactly the same pixels as a nearby normal-sized pedestrian, requiring the AI to judge the relative likelihood and reasonableness of different interpretations, for example by using its \"object model\" to assess that fifty-meter pedestrians do not exist.\\n',\n",
       " 'AI is heavily used in robotics. Advanced robotic arms and other industrial robots, widely used in modern factories, can learn from experience how to move efficiently despite the presence of friction and gear slippage. A modern mobile robot, when given a small, static, and visible environment, can easily determine its location and map its environment; however, dynamic environments, such as (in endoscopy) the interior of a patient\\'s breathing body, pose a greater challenge. Motion planning is the process of breaking down a movement task into \"primitives\" such as individual joint movements. Such movement often involves compliant motion, a process where movement requires maintaining physical contact with an object. Moravec\\'s paradox generalizes that low-level sensorimotor skills that humans take for granted are, counterintuitively, difficult to program into a robot; the paradox is named after Hans Moravec, who stated in 1988 that \"it is comparatively easy to make computers exhibit adult level performance on intelligence tests or playing checkers, and difficult or impossible to give them the skills of a one-year-old when it comes to perception and mobility\". This is attributed to the fact that, unlike checkers, physical dexterity has been a direct target of natural selection for millions of years.\\n',\n",
       " \"Moravec's paradox can be extended to many forms of social intelligence. Distributed multi-agent coordination of autonomous vehicles remains a difficult problem. Affective computing is an interdisciplinary umbrella that comprises systems which recognize, interpret, process, or simulate human affects. Moderate successes related to affective computing include textual sentiment analysis and, more recently, multimodal affect analysis (see multimodal sentiment analysis), wherein AI classifies the affects displayed by a videotaped subject.\\n\",\n",
       " 'In the long run, social skills and an understanding of human emotion and game theory would be valuable to a social agent. Being able to predict the actions of others by understanding their motives and emotional states would allow an agent to make better decisions. Some computer systems mimic human emotion and expressions to appear more sensitive to the emotional dynamics of human interaction, or to otherwise facilitate human–computer interaction. Similarly, some virtual assistants are programmed to speak conversationally or even to banter humorously; this tends to give naïve users an unrealistic conception of how intelligent existing computer agents actually are.\\n',\n",
       " 'Historically, projects such as the Cyc knowledge base (1984–) and the massive Japanese Fifth Generation Computer Systems initiative (1982–1992) attempted to cover the breadth of human cognition. These early projects failed to escape the limitations of non-quantitative symbolic logic models and, in retrospect, greatly underestimated the difficulty of cross-domain AI. Nowadays, the vast majority of current AI researchers work instead on tractable \"narrow AI\" applications (such as medical diagnosis or automobile navigation). Many researchers predict that such \"narrow AI\" work in different individual domains will eventually be incorporated into a machine with artificial general intelligence (AGI), combining most of the narrow skills mentioned in this article and at some point even exceeding human ability in most or all these areas. Many advances have general, cross-domain significance. One high-profile example is that DeepMind in the 2010s developed a \"generalized artificial intelligence\" that could learn many diverse Atari games on its own, and later developed a variant of the system which succeeds at sequential learning. Besides transfer learning, hypothetical AGI breakthroughs could include the development of reflective architectures that can engage in decision-theoretic metareasoning, and figuring out how to \"slurp up\" a comprehensive knowledge base from the entire unstructured Web. Some argue that some kind of (currently-undiscovered) conceptually straightforward, but mathematically difficult, \"Master Algorithm\" could lead to AGI. Finally, a few \"emergent\" approaches look to simulating human intelligence extremely closely, and believe that anthropomorphic features like an artificial brain or simulated child development may someday reach a critical point where general intelligence emerges.\\n',\n",
       " 'Many of the problems in this article may also require general intelligence, if machines are to solve the problems as well as people do. For example, even specific straightforward tasks, like machine translation, require that a machine read and write in both languages (NLP), follow the author\\'s argument (reason), know what is being talked about (knowledge), and faithfully reproduce the author\\'s original intent (social intelligence). A problem like machine translation is considered \"AI-complete\", because all of these problems need to be solved simultaneously in order to reach human-level machine performance.\\n',\n",
       " 'There is no established unifying theory or paradigm that guides AI research. Researchers disagree about many issues. A few of the most long standing questions that have remained unanswered are these: should artificial intelligence simulate natural intelligence by studying psychology or neurobiology?

Or does it necessarily require solving a large number of completely unrelated problems?\\n',\n",

Some of them built machines that used electronic networks to exhibit rudimentary intelligence, such as W. Grey Walter's turtles and the Johns Hopkins Beast. Many of these researchers gathered for meetings of the Teleological Society at Princeton University and the Ratio Club in England. By 1960, this approach was largely abandoned, although elements of it would be revived in the 1980s.\\n\",\n",

The research was centered in three institutions: Carnegie Mellon University, Stanford and MIT, and as described below, each one developed its own style of research. John Haugeland named these symbolic approaches to AI \"good old fashioned AI\" or \"GOFAI\". During the 1960s, symbolic approaches had achieved great success at simulating high-level \"thinking\" in small demonstration programs. Approaches based on cybernetics or artificial neural networks were abandoned or pushed into the background.\\nResearchers in the 1960s and the 1970s were convinced that symbolic approaches would eventually succeed in creating a machine with artificial general intelligence and considered this the goal of their field.\\n',\n",

Their research team used the results of psychological experiments to develop programs that simulated the techniques that people used to solve problems. This tradition, centered at Carnegie Mellon University would eventually culminate in the development of the Soar architecture in the middle 1980s.\\n',\n",
       " 'Unlike Simon and Newell, John McCarthy felt that machines did not need to simulate human thought, but should instead try to find the essence of abstract reasoning and problem-solving, regardless whether people used the same algorithms. His laboratory at Stanford (SAIL) focused on using formal logic to solve a wide variety of problems, including knowledge representation, planning and learning. Logic was also the focus of the work at the University of Edinburgh and elsewhere in Europe which led to the development of the programming language Prolog and the science of logic programming.\\n',\n",

Roger Schank described their \"anti-logic\" approaches as \"scruffy\" (as opposed to the \"neat\" paradigms at CMU and Stanford). Commonsense knowledge bases (such as Doug Lenat\\'s Cyc) are an example of \"scruffy\" AI, since they must be built by hand, one complicated concept at a time.\\n',\n",

This \"knowledge revolution\" led to the development and deployment of expert systems (introduced by Edward Feigenbaum), the first truly successful form of AI software. A key component of the system architecture for all expert systems is the knowledge base, which stores facts and rules that illustrate AI. The knowledge revolution was also driven by the realization that enormous amounts of knowledge would be required by many simple AI applications.\\n',\n",

Sub-symbolic methods manage to approach intelligence without specific representations of knowledge.\\n',\n",

Researchers from the related field of robotics, such as Rodney Brooks, rejected symbolic AI and focused on the basic engineering problems that would allow robots to move and survive. Their work revived the non-symbolic point of view of the early cybernetics researchers of the 1950s and reintroduced the use of control theory in AI. This coincided with the development of the embodied mind thesis in the related field of cognitive science: the idea that aspects of the body (such as movement, perception and visualization) are required for higher intelligence.\\n',\n",

Artificial neural networks are an example of soft computing—they are solutions to problems which cannot be solved with complete logical certainty, and where an approximate solution is often sufficient. Other soft computing approaches to AI include fuzzy systems, Grey system theory, evolutionary computation and many statistical tools. The application of soft computing to AI is studied collectively by the emerging discipline of computational intelligence.\\n',\n",
       " 'Much of traditional GOFAI got bogged down on ad hoc patches to symbolic computation that worked on their own toy models but failed to generalize to real-world results. However, around the 1990s, AI researchers adopted sophisticated mathematical tools, such as hidden Markov models (HMM), information theory, and normative Bayesian decision theory to compare or to unify competing architectures. The shared mathematical language permitted a high level of collaboration with more established fields (like mathematics, economics or operations research).[d] Compared with GOFAI, new \"statistical learning\" techniques such as HMM and neural networks were gaining higher levels of accuracy in many practical domains such as data mining, without necessarily acquiring a semantic understanding of the datasets. The increased successes with real-world data led to increasing emphasis on comparing different approaches against shared test data to see which approach performed best in a broader context than that provided by idiosyncratic toy models; AI research was becoming more scientific. Nowadays results of experiments are often rigorously measurable, and are sometimes (with difficulty) reproducible. Different statistical learning techniques have different limitations; for example, basic HMM cannot model the infinite possible combinations of natural language. Critics note that the shift from GOFAI to statistical learning is often also a shift away from explainable AI. In AGI research, some scholars caution against over-reliance on statistical learning, and argue that continuing research into GOFAI will still be necessary to attain general intelligence.\\n',\n",
       " 'AI has developed many tools to solve the most difficult problems in computer science. A few of the most general of these methods are discussed below.\\n',\n",
       " 'Many problems in AI can be solved in theory by intelligently searching through many possible solutions: Reasoning can be reduced to performing a search. For example, logical proof can be viewed as searching for a path that leads from premises to conclusions, where each step is the application of an inference rule. Planning algorithms search through trees of goals and subgoals, attempting to find a path to a target goal, a process called means-ends analysis. Robotics algorithms for moving limbs and grasping objects use local searches in configuration space. Many learning algorithms use search algorithms based on optimization.\\n',\n",
       " 'Simple exhaustive searches are rarely sufficient for most real-world problems: the search space (the number of places to search) quickly grows to astronomical numbers. The result is a search that is too slow or never completes. The solution, for many problems, is to use \"heuristics\" or \"rules of thumb\" that prioritize choices in favor of those that are more likely to reach a goal and to do so in a shorter number of steps. In some search methodologies heuristics can also serve to entirely eliminate some choices that are unlikely to lead to a goal (called \"pruning the search tree\"). Heuristics supply the program with a \"best guess\" for the path on which the solution lies. Heuristics limit the search for solutions into a smaller sample size.\\n',\n",
       " 'A very different kind of search came to prominence in the 1990s, based on the mathematical theory of optimization. For many problems, it is possible to begin the search with some form of a guess and then refine the guess incrementally until no more refinements can be made. These algorithms can be visualized as blind hill climbing: we begin the search at a random point on the landscape, and then, by jumps or steps, we keep moving our guess uphill, until we reach the top. Other optimization algorithms are simulated annealing, beam search and random optimization.\\n',\n",
       " 'Evolutionary computation uses a form of optimization search. For example, they may begin with a population of organisms (the guesses) and then allow them to mutate and recombine, selecting only the fittest to survive each generation (refining the guesses). Classic evolutionary algorithms include genetic algorithms, gene expression programming, and genetic programming. Alternatively, distributed search processes can coordinate via swarm intelligence algorithms. Two popular swarm algorithms used in search are particle swarm optimization (inspired by bird flocking) and ant colony optimization (inspired by ant trails).\\n',\n",
       " 'Logic is used for knowledge representation and problem solving, but it can be applied to other problems as well. For example, the satplan algorithm uses logic for planning and inductive logic programming is a method for learning.\\n',\n",
       " 'Several different forms of logic are used in AI research. Propositional logic involves truth functions such as \"or\" and \"not\". First-order logic adds quantifiers and predicates, and can express facts about objects, their properties, and their relations with each other. Fuzzy set theory assigns a \"degree of truth\" (between 0 and 1) to vague statements such as \"Alice is old\" (or rich, or tall, or hungry) that are too linguistically imprecise to be completely true or false. Fuzzy logic is successfully used in control systems to allow experts to contribute vague rules such as \"if you are close to the destination station and moving fast, increase the train\\'s brake pressure\"; these vague rules can then be numerically refined within the system. Fuzzy logic fails to scale well in knowledge bases; many AI researchers question the validity of chaining fuzzy-logic inferences.[e]\\n',\n",
       " 'Default logics, non-monotonic logics and circumscription are forms of logic designed to help with default reasoning and the qualification problem. Several extensions of logic have been designed to handle specific domains of knowledge, such as: description logics; situation calculus, event calculus and fluent calculus (for representing events and time); causal calculus; belief calculus (belief revision); and modal logics. Logics to model contradictory or inconsistent statements arising in multi-agent systems have also been designed, such as paraconsistent logics. \\n',\n",
       " 'Many problems in AI (in reasoning, planning, learning, perception, and robotics) require the agent to operate with incomplete or uncertain information. AI researchers have devised a number of powerful tools to solve these problems using methods from probability theory and economics.\\n',\n",
       " 'Bayesian networks are a very general tool that can be used for various problems: reasoning (using the Bayesian inference algorithm), learning (using the expectation-maximization algorithm),[f] planning (using decision networks) and perception (using dynamic Bayesian networks). Probabilistic algorithms can also be used for filtering, prediction, smoothing and finding explanations for streams of data, helping perception systems to analyze processes that occur over time (e.g., hidden Markov models or Kalman filters). Compared with symbolic logic, formal Bayesian inference is computationally expensive. For inference to be tractable, most observations must be conditionally independent of one another. Complicated graphs with diamonds or other \"loops\" (undirected cycles) can require a sophisticated method such as Markov chain Monte Carlo, which spreads an ensemble of random walkers throughout the Bayesian network and attempts to converge to an assessment of the conditional probabilities. Bayesian networks are used on Xbox Live to rate and match players; wins and losses are \"evidence\" of how good a player is[citation needed]. AdSense uses a Bayesian network with over 300 million edges to learn which ads to serve.\\n',\n",
       " 'A key concept from the science of economics is \"utility\": a measure of how valuable something is to an intelligent agent. Precise mathematical tools have been developed that analyze how an agent can make choices and plan, using decision theory, decision analysis, and information value theory. These tools include models such as Markov decision processes, dynamic decision networks, game theory and mechanism design.\\n',\n",
       " 'The simplest AI applications can be divided into two types: classifiers (\"if shiny then diamond\") and controllers (\"if shiny then pick up\"). Controllers do, however, also classify conditions before inferring actions, and therefore classification forms a central part of many AI systems. Classifiers are functions that use pattern matching to determine a closest match. They can be tuned according to examples, making them very attractive for use in AI. These examples are known as observations or patterns. In supervised learning, each pattern belongs to a certain predefined class. A class can be seen as a decision that has to be made. All the observations combined with their class labels are known as a data set. When a new observation is received, that observation is classified based on previous experience.\\n',\n",
       " 'A classifier can be trained in various ways; there are many statistical and machine learning approaches. The decision tree is perhaps the most widely used machine learning algorithm. Other widely used classifiers are the neural network,\\nk-nearest neighbor algorithm,[g]\\nkernel methods such as the support vector machine (SVM),[h]\\nGaussian mixture model, and the extremely popular naive Bayes classifier.[i] Classifier performance depends greatly on the characteristics of the data to be classified, such as the dataset size, distribution of samples across classes, the dimensionality, and the level of noise. Model-based classifiers perform well if the assumed model is an extremely good fit for the actual data. Otherwise, if no matching model is available, and if accuracy (rather than speed or scalability) is the sole concern, conventional wisdom is that discriminative classifiers (especially SVM) tend to be more accurate than model-based classifiers such as \"naive Bayes\" on most practical data sets.\\n',\n",
       " 'Neural networks were inspired by the architecture of neurons in the human brain. A simple \"neuron\" N accepts input from other neurons, each of which, when activated (or \"fired\"), cast a weighted \"vote\" for or against whether neuron N should itself activate. Learning requires an algorithm to adjust these weights based on the training data; one simple algorithm (dubbed \"fire together, wire together\") is to increase the weight between two connected neurons when the activation of one triggers the successful activation of another. The neural network forms \"concepts\" that are distributed among a subnetwork of shared[j] neurons that tend to fire together; a concept meaning \"leg\" might be coupled with a subnetwork meaning \"foot\" that includes the sound for \"foot\". Neurons have a continuous spectrum of activation; in addition, neurons can process inputs in a nonlinear way rather than weighing straightforward votes. Modern neural networks can learn both continuous functions and, surprisingly, digital logical operations.

Then we detail \"spidering\" or walking through hyperlinks to build samples of online content, and using APIs, Application Programming Interfaces, provided by webservices to access their content. Along the way, we will use regular expressions, outlined in the reading, to remove unwanted formatting and ornamentation. Finally, we discuss various text encodings, filtering and data structures in which text can be placed for analysis.\n",

       " '      “Now, Kitty, you may cough as much as you choose,” said Mr.\\n      Bennet; and, as he spoke, he left the room, fatigued with the\\n      raptures of his wife.',\n",

At our time of\\n      life it is not so pleasant, I can tell you, to be making new\\n      acquaintances every day; but for your sakes, we would do\\n      anything.

       " '      Not all that Mrs. Bennet, however, with the assistance of her\\n      five daughters, could ask on the subject, was sufficient to draw\\n      from her husband any satisfactory description of Mr. Bingley.\\n      They attacked him in various ways—with barefaced questions,\\n      ingenious suppositions, and distant surmises; but he eluded the\\n      skill of them all, and they were at last obliged to accept the\\n      second-hand intelligence of their neighbour, Lady Lucas. Her\\n      report was highly favourable. Sir William had been delighted with\\n      him. He was quite young, wonderfully handsome, extremely\\n      agreeable, and, to crown the whole, he meant to be at the next\\n      assembly with a large party. Nothing could be more delightful! To\\n      be fond of dancing was a certain step towards falling in love;\\n      and very lively hopes of Mr. Bingley’s heart were entertained.',\n",
       " '      “If I can but see one of my daughters happily settled at\\n      Netherfield,” said Mrs. Bennet to her husband, “and all the\\n      others equally well married, I shall have nothing to wish for.”',\n",
       " '      In a few days Mr. Bingley returned Mr. Bennet’s visit, and sat\\n      about ten minutes with him in his library. He had entertained\\n      hopes of being admitted to a sight of the young ladies, of whose\\n      beauty he had heard much; but he saw only the father. The ladies\\n      were somewhat more fortunate, for they had the advantage of\\n      ascertaining from an upper window that he wore a blue coat, and\\n      rode a black horse.',\n",
       " '      An invitation to dinner was soon afterwards dispatched; and\\n      already had Mrs. Bennet planned the courses that were to do\\n      credit to her housekeeping, when an answer arrived which deferred\\n      it all. Mr. Bingley was obliged to be in town the following day,\\n      and, consequently, unable to accept the honour of their\\n      invitation, etc. Mrs. Bennet was quite disconcerted. She could\\n      not imagine what business he could have in town so soon after his\\n      arrival in Hertfordshire; and she began to fear that he might be\\n      always flying about from one place to another, and never settled\\n      at Netherfield as he ought to be. Lady Lucas quieted her fears a\\n      little by starting the idea of his being gone to London only to\\n      get a large party for the ball; and a report soon followed that\\n      Mr. Bingley was to bring twelve ladies and seven gentlemen with\\n      him to the assembly. The girls grieved over such a number of\\n      ladies, but were comforted the day before the ball by hearing,\\n      that instead of twelve he brought only six with him from\\n      London—his five sisters and a cousin. And when the party entered\\n      the assembly room it consisted of only five altogether—Mr.\\n      Bingley, his two sisters, the husband of the eldest, and another\\n      young man.',\n",
       " '      Mr. Bingley was good-looking and gentlemanlike; he had a pleasant\\n      countenance, and easy, unaffected manners. His sisters were fine\\n      women, with an air of decided fashion. His brother-in-law, Mr.\\n      Hurst, merely looked the gentleman; but his friend Mr. Darcy soon\\n      drew the attention of the room by his fine, tall person, handsome\\n      features, noble mien, and the report which was in general\\n      circulation within five minutes after his entrance, of his having\\n      ten thousand a year. The gentlemen pronounced him to be a fine\\n      figure of a man, the ladies declared he was much handsomer than\\n      Mr. Bingley, and he was looked at with great admiration for about\\n      half the evening, till his manners gave a disgust which turned\\n      the tide of his popularity; for he was discovered to be proud; to\\n      be above his company, and above being pleased; and not all his\\n      large estate in Derbyshire could then save him from having a most\\n      forbidding, disagreeable countenance, and being unworthy to be\\n      compared with his friend.',\n",
       " '      Mr. Bingley had soon made himself acquainted with all the\\n      principal people in the room; he was lively and unreserved,\\n      danced every dance, was angry that the ball closed so early, and\\n      talked of giving one himself at Netherfield. Such amiable\\n      qualities must speak for themselves. What a contrast between him\\n      and his friend! Mr. Darcy danced only once with Mrs. Hurst and\\n      once with Miss Bingley, declined being introduced to any other\\n      lady, and spent the rest of the evening in walking about the\\n      room, speaking occasionally to one of his own party. His\\n      character was decided. He was the proudest, most disagreeable man\\n      in the world, and everybody hoped that he would never come there\\n      again. Amongst the most violent against him was Mrs. Bennet,\\n      whose dislike of his general behaviour was sharpened into\\n      particular resentment by his having slighted one of her\\n      daughters.',\n",
       " '      Elizabeth Bennet had been obliged, by the scarcity of gentlemen,\\n      to sit down for two dances; and during part of that time, Mr.\\n      Darcy had been standing near enough for her to hear a\\n      conversation between him and Mr. Bingley, who came from the dance\\n      for a few minutes, to press his friend to join it.',\n",
       " '      “Come, Darcy,” said he, “I must have you dance. I hate to see you\\n      standing about by yourself in this stupid manner. You had much\\n      better dance.”',\n",
       " '      “I certainly shall not. You know how I detest it, unless I am\\n      particularly acquainted with my partner. At such an assembly as\\n      this it would be insupportable. Your sisters are engaged, and\\n      there is not another woman in the room whom it would not be a\\n      punishment to me to stand up with.”',\n",
       " '      “I would not be so fastidious as you are,” cried Mr. Bingley,\\n      “for a kingdom! Upon my honour, I never met with so many pleasant\\n      girls in my life as I have this evening; and there are several of\\n      them you see uncommonly pretty.”',\n",
       " '      “_You_ are dancing with the only handsome girl in the room,” said\\n      Mr. Darcy, looking at the eldest Miss Bennet.',\n",
       " '      “Oh! She is the most beautiful creature I ever beheld! But there\\n      is one of her sisters sitting down just behind you, who is very\\n      pretty, and I dare say very agreeable. Do let me ask my partner\\n      to introduce you.”',\n",
       " '      “Which do you mean?” and turning round he looked for a moment at\\n      Elizabeth, till catching her eye, he withdrew his own and coldly\\n      said: “She is tolerable, but not handsome enough to tempt _me_; I\\n      am in no humour at present to give consequence to young ladies\\n      who are slighted by other men. You had better return to your\\n      partner and enjoy her smiles, for you are wasting your time with\\n      me.”',\n",
       " '      Mr. Bingley followed his advice. Mr. Darcy walked off; and\\n      Elizabeth remained with no very cordial feelings toward him. She\\n      told the story, however, with great spirit among her friends; for\\n      she had a lively, playful disposition, which delighted in\\n      anything ridiculous.',\n",
       " '      The evening altogether passed off pleasantly to the whole family.\\n      Mrs. Bennet had seen her eldest daughter much admired by the\\n      Netherfield party. Mr. Bingley had danced with her twice, and she\\n      had been distinguished by his sisters. Jane was as much gratified\\n      by this as her mother could be, though in a quieter way.\\n      Elizabeth felt Jane’s pleasure. Mary had heard herself mentioned\\n      to Miss Bingley as the most accomplished girl in the\\n      neighbourhood; and Catherine and Lydia had been fortunate enough\\n      never to be without partners, which was all that they had yet\\n      learnt to care for at a ball. They returned, therefore, in good\\n      spirits to Longbourn, the village where they lived, and of which\\n      they were the principal inhabitants. They found Mr. Bennet still\\n      up. With a book he was regardless of time; and on the present\\n      occasion he had a good deal of curiosity as to the event of an\\n      evening which had raised such splendid expectations. He had\\n      rather hoped that his wife’s views on the stranger would be\\n      disappointed; but he soon found out that he had a different story\\n      to hear.',\n",
       " '      “Oh, my dear Mr. Bennet,” as she entered the room, “we have had a\\n      most delightful evening, a most excellent ball. I wish you had\\n      been there. Jane was so admired, nothing could be like it.\\n      Everybody said how well she looked; and Mr. Bingley thought her\\n      quite beautiful, and danced with her twice! Only think of _that_,\\n      my dear; he actually danced with her twice! and she was the only\\n      creature in the room that he asked a second time. First of all,\\n      he asked Miss Lucas. I was so vexed to see him stand up with her!\\n      But, however, he did not admire her at all; indeed, nobody can,\\n      you know; and he seemed quite struck with Jane as she was going\\n      down the dance. So he inquired who she was, and got introduced,\\n      and asked her for the two next. Then the two third he danced with\\n      Miss King, and the two fourth with Maria Lucas, and the two fifth\\n      with Jane again, and the two sixth with Lizzy, and the\\n      _Boulanger_—”',\n",
       " '      “If he had had any compassion for _me_,” cried her husband\\n      impatiently, “he would not have danced half so much! For God’s\\n      sake, say no more of his partners. Oh that he had sprained his\\n      ankle in the first dance!”',\n",
       " '      “Oh! my dear, I am quite delighted with him. He is so excessively\\n      handsome! And his sisters are charming women. I never in my life\\n      saw anything more elegant than their dresses. I dare say the lace\\n      upon Mrs. Hurst’s gown—”',\n",
       " '      Here she was interrupted again. Mr. Bennet protested against any\\n      description of finery. She was therefore obliged to seek another\\n      branch of the subject, and related, with much bitterness of\\n      spirit and some exaggeration, the shocking rudeness of Mr. Darcy.',\n",
       " '      “But I can assure you,” she added, “that Lizzy does not lose much\\n      by not suiting _his_ fancy; for he is a most disagreeable, horrid\\n      man, not at all worth pleasing. So high and so conceited that\\n      there was no enduring him! He walked here, and he walked there,\\n      fancying himself so very great! Not handsome enough to dance\\n      with! I wish you had been there, my dear, to have given him one\\n      of your set-downs. I quite detest the man.”',\n",

       " '      When Jane and Elizabeth were alone, the former, who had been\\n      cautious in her praise of Mr. Bingley before, expressed to her\\n      sister just how very much she admired him.',\n",
       " '      “He is just what a young man ought to be,” said she, “sensible,\\n      good-humoured, lively; and I never saw such happy manners!—so\\n      much ease, with such perfect good breeding!”',\n",
       " '      “He is also handsome,” replied Elizabeth, “which a young man\\n      ought likewise to be, if he possibly can. His character is\\n      thereby complete.”',\n",

       " '      “Did not you? _I_ did for you. But that is one great difference\\n      between us. Compliments always take _you_ by surprise, and _me_\\n      never. What could be more natural than his asking you again? He\\n      could not help seeing that you were about five times as pretty as\\n      every other woman in the room. No thanks to his gallantry for\\n      that. Well, he certainly is very agreeable, and I give you leave\\n      to like him. You have liked many a stupider person.”',\n",
       " '      “Dear Lizzy!”',\n",
       " '      “Oh! you are a great deal too apt, you know, to like people in\\n      general. You never see a fault in anybody. All the world are good\\n      and agreeable in your eyes. I never heard you speak ill of a\\n      human being in your life.”',\n",
       " '      “I would not wish to be hasty in censuring anyone; but I always\\n      speak what I think.”',\n",

Affectation of candour is common enough—one\\n      meets with it everywhere. But to be candid without ostentation or\\n      design—to take the good of everybody’s character and make it\\n      still better, and say nothing of the bad—belongs to you alone.\\n      And so you like this man’s sisters, too, do you? Their manners\\n      are not equal to his.”',\n",
       " '      “Certainly not—at first. But they are very pleasing women when\\n      you converse with them. Miss Bingley is to live with her brother,\\n      and keep his house; and I am much mistaken if we shall not find a\\n      very charming neighbour in her.”',\n",
       " '      Elizabeth listened in silence, but was not convinced; their\\n      behaviour at the assembly had not been calculated to please in\\n      general; and with more quickness of observation and less pliancy\\n      of temper than her sister, and with a judgement too unassailed by\\n      any attention to herself, she was very little disposed to approve\\n      them. They were in fact very fine ladies; not deficient in good\\n      humour when they were pleased, nor in the power of making\\n      themselves agreeable when they chose it, but proud and conceited.\\n      They were rather handsome, had been educated in one of the first\\n      private seminaries in town, had a fortune of twenty thousand\\n      pounds, were in the habit of spending more than they ought, and\\n      of associating with people of rank, and were therefore in every\\n      respect entitled to think well of themselves, and meanly of\\n      others. They were of a respectable family in the north of\\n      England; a circumstance more deeply impressed on their memories\\n      than that their brother’s fortune and their own had been acquired\\n      by trade.',\n",
       " '      Mr. Bingley inherited property to the amount of nearly a hundred\\n      thousand pounds from his father, who had intended to purchase an\\n      estate, but did not live to do it. Mr. Bingley intended it\\n      likewise, and sometimes made choice of his county; but as he was\\n      now provided with a good house and the liberty of a manor, it was\\n      doubtful to many of those who best knew the easiness of his\\n      temper, whether he might not spend the remainder of his days at\\n      Netherfield, and leave the next generation to purchase.',\n",
       " '      His sisters were anxious for his having an estate of his own;\\n      but, though he was now only established as a tenant, Miss Bingley\\n      was by no means unwilling to preside at his table—nor was Mrs.\\n      Hurst, who had married a man of more fashion than fortune, less\\n      disposed to consider his house as her home when it suited her.\\n      Mr. Bingley had not been of age two years, when he was tempted by\\n      an accidental recommendation to look at Netherfield House. He did\\n      look at it, and into it for half-an-hour—was pleased with the\\n      situation and the principal rooms, satisfied with what the owner\\n      said in its praise, and took it immediately.',\n",
       " '      Between him and Darcy there was a very steady friendship, in\\n      spite of great opposition of character. Bingley was endeared to\\n      Darcy by the easiness, openness, and ductility of his temper,\\n      though no disposition could offer a greater contrast to his own,\\n      and though with his own he never appeared dissatisfied. On the\\n      strength of Darcy’s regard, Bingley had the firmest reliance, and\\n      of his judgement the highest opinion. In understanding, Darcy was\\n      the superior. Bingley was by no means deficient, but Darcy was\\n      clever. He was at the same time haughty, reserved, and\\n      fastidious, and his manners, though well-bred, were not inviting.\\n      In that respect his friend had greatly the advantage. Bingley was\\n      sure of being liked wherever he appeared, Darcy was continually\\n      giving offense.',\n",
       " '      The manner in which they spoke of the Meryton assembly was\\n      sufficiently characteristic. Bingley had never met with more\\n      pleasant people or prettier girls in his life; everybody had been\\n      most kind and attentive to him; there had been no formality, no\\n      stiffness; he had soon felt acquainted with all the room; and, as\\n      to Miss Bennet, he could not conceive an angel more beautiful.\\n      Darcy, on the contrary, had seen a collection of people in whom\\n      there was little beauty and no fashion, for none of whom he had\\n      felt the smallest interest, and from none received either\\n      attention or pleasure. Miss Bennet he acknowledged to be pretty,\\n      but she smiled too much.',\n",
       " '      Mrs. Hurst and her sister allowed it to be so—but still they\\n      admired her and liked her, and pronounced her to be a sweet girl,\\n      and one whom they would not object to know more of.

       " '      Within a short walk of Longbourn lived a family with whom the\\n      Bennets were particularly intimate. Sir William Lucas had been\\n      formerly in trade in Meryton, where he had made a tolerable\\n      fortune, and risen to the honour of knighthood by an address to\\n      the king during his mayoralty. The distinction had perhaps been\\n      felt too strongly. It had given him a disgust to his business,\\n      and to his residence in a small market town; and, in quitting\\n      them both, he had removed with his family to a house about a mile\\n      from Meryton, denominated from that period Lucas Lodge, where he\\n      could think with pleasure of his own importance, and, unshackled\\n      by business, occupy himself solely in being civil to all the\\n      world. For, though elated by his rank, it did not render him\\n      supercilious; on the contrary, he was all attention to everybody.\\n      By nature inoffensive, friendly, and obliging, his presentation\\n      at St. James’s had made him courteous.',\n",
       " '      Lady Lucas was a very good kind of woman, not too clever to be a\\n      valuable neighbour to Mrs. Bennet. They had several children. The\\n      eldest of them, a sensible, intelligent young woman, about\\n      twenty-seven, was Elizabeth’s intimate friend.',\n",
       " '      That the Miss Lucases and the Miss Bennets should meet to talk\\n      over a ball was absolutely necessary; and the morning after the\\n      assembly brought the former to Longbourn to hear and to\\n      communicate.',\n",
       " '      “_You_ began the evening well, Charlotte,” said Mrs. Bennet with\\n      civil self-command to Miss Lucas. “_You_ were Mr. Bingley’s first\\n      choice.”',\n",

       " '      “Perhaps you mean what I overheard between him and Mr. Robinson;\\n      did not I mention it to you? Mr. Robinson’s asking him how he\\n      liked our Meryton assemblies, and whether he did not think there\\n      were a great many pretty women in the room, and _which_ he\\n      thought the prettiest? and his answering immediately to the last\\n      question: ‘Oh! the eldest Miss Bennet, beyond a doubt; there\\n      cannot be two opinions on that point.’”',\n",

       " '      “His pride,” said Miss Lucas, “does not offend _me_ so much as\\n      pride often does, because there is an excuse for it. One cannot\\n      wonder that so very fine a young man, with family, fortune,\\n      everything in his favour, should think highly of himself.

By all\\n      that I have ever read, I am convinced that it is very common\\n      indeed; that human nature is particularly prone to it, and that\\n      there are very few of us who do not cherish a feeling of\\n      self-complacency on the score of some quality or other, real or\\n      imaginary. Vanity and pride are different things, though the\\n      words are often used synonymously. A person may be proud without\\n      being vain.

       " '      “Then you would drink a great deal more than you ought,” said\\n      Mrs. Bennet; “and if I were to see you at it, I should take away\\n      your bottle directly.”',\n",

       " '      The ladies of Longbourn soon waited on those of Netherfield. The\\n      visit was soon returned in due form. Miss Bennet’s pleasing\\n      manners grew on the goodwill of Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley; and\\n      though the mother was found to be intolerable, and the younger\\n      sisters not worth speaking to, a wish of being better acquainted\\n      with _them_ was expressed towards the two eldest. By Jane, this\\n      attention was received with the greatest pleasure, but Elizabeth\\n      still saw superciliousness in their treatment of everybody,\\n      hardly excepting even her sister, and could not like them; though\\n      their kindness to Jane, such as it was, had a value as arising in\\n      all probability from the influence of their brother’s admiration.\\n      It was generally evident whenever they met, that he _did_ admire\\n      her and to _her_ it was equally evident that Jane was yielding to\\n      the preference which she had begun to entertain for him from the\\n      first, and was in a way to be very much in love; but she\\n      considered with pleasure that it was not likely to be discovered\\n      by the world in general, since Jane united, with great strength\\n      of feeling, a composure of temper and a uniform cheerfulness of\\n      manner which would guard her from the suspicions of the\\n      impertinent. She mentioned this to her friend Miss Lucas.',\n",
       " '      “It may perhaps be pleasant,” replied Charlotte, “to be able to\\n      impose on the public in such a case; but it is sometimes a\\n      disadvantage to be so very guarded. If a woman conceals her\\n      affection with the same skill from the object of it, she may lose\\n      the opportunity of fixing him; and it will then be but poor\\n      consolation to believe the world equally in the dark. There is so\\n      much of gratitude or vanity in almost every attachment, that it\\n      is not safe to leave any to itself. We can all _begin_ freely—a\\n      slight preference is natural enough; but there are very few of us\\n      who have heart enough to be really in love without encouragement.\\n      In nine cases out of ten a woman had better show _more_ affection\\n      than she feels. Bingley likes your sister undoubtedly; but he may\\n      never do more than like her, if she does not help him on.”',\n",
       " '      “But she does help him on, as much as her nature will allow. If\\n      _I_ can perceive her regard for him, he must be a simpleton,\\n      indeed, not to discover it too.”',\n",
       " '      “Remember, Eliza, that he does not know Jane’s disposition as you\\n      do.”',\n",
       " '      “But if a woman is partial to a man, and does not endeavour to\\n      conceal it, he must find it out.”',\n",
       " '      “Perhaps he must, if he sees enough of her. But, though Bingley\\n      and Jane meet tolerably often, it is never for many hours\\n      together; and, as they always see each other in large mixed\\n      parties, it is impossible that every moment should be employed in\\n      conversing together. Jane should therefore make the most of every\\n      half-hour in which she can command his attention. When she is\\n      secure of him, there will be more leisure for falling in love as\\n      much as she chooses.”',\n",
       " '      “Your plan is a good one,” replied Elizabeth, “where nothing is\\n      in question but the desire of being well married, and if I were\\n      determined to get a rich husband, or any husband, I dare say I\\n      should adopt it. But these are not Jane’s feelings; she is not\\n      acting by design. As yet, she cannot even be certain of the\\n      degree of her own regard nor of its reasonableness. She has known\\n      him only a fortnight. She danced four dances with him at Meryton;\\n      she saw him one morning at his own house, and has since dined\\n      with him in company four times. This is not quite enough to make\\n      her understand his character.”',\n",
       " '      “Not as you represent it. Had she merely _dined_ with him, she\\n      might only have discovered whether he had a good appetite; but\\n      you must remember that four evenings have also been spent\\n      together—and four evenings may do a great deal.”',\n",
       " '      “Yes; these four evenings have enabled them to ascertain that\\n      they both like Vingt-un better than Commerce; but with respect to\\n      any other leading characteristic, I do not imagine that much has\\n      been unfolded.”',\n",
       " '      “Well,” said Charlotte, “I wish Jane success with all my heart;\\n      and if she were married to him to-morrow, I should think she had\\n      as good a chance of happiness as if she were to be studying his\\n      character for a twelvemonth. Happiness in marriage is entirely a\\n      matter of chance. If the dispositions of the parties are ever so\\n      well known to each other or ever so similar beforehand, it does\\n      not advance their felicity in the least. They always continue to\\n      grow sufficiently unlike afterwards to have their share of\\n      vexation; and it is better to know as little as possible of the\\n      defects of the person with whom you are to pass your life.”',\n",
       " '      “You make me laugh, Charlotte; but it is not sound. You know it\\n      is not sound, and that you would never act in this way yourself.”',\n",
       " '      Occupied in observing Mr. Bingley’s attentions to her sister,\\n      Elizabeth was far from suspecting that she was herself becoming\\n      an object of some interest in the eyes of his friend. Mr. Darcy\\n      had at first scarcely allowed her to be pretty; he had looked at\\n      her without admiration at the ball; and when they next met, he\\n      looked at her only to criticise. But no sooner had he made it\\n      clear to himself and his friends that she hardly had a good\\n      feature in her face, than he began to find it was rendered\\n      uncommonly intelligent by the beautiful expression of her dark\\n      eyes. To this discovery succeeded some others equally mortifying.\\n      Though he had detected with a critical eye more than one failure\\n      of perfect symmetry in her form, he was forced to acknowledge her\\n      figure to be light and pleasing; and in spite of his asserting\\n      that her manners were not those of the fashionable world, he was\\n      caught by their easy playfulness. Of this she was perfectly\\n      unaware; to her he was only the man who made himself agreeable\\n      nowhere, and who had not thought her handsome enough to dance\\n      with.',\n",
       " '      He began to wish to know more of her, and as a step towards\\n      conversing with her himself, attended to her conversation with\\n      others. His doing so drew her notice. It was at Sir William\\n      Lucas’s, where a large party were assembled.',\n",
       " '      “What does Mr. Darcy mean,” said she to Charlotte, “by listening\\n      to my conversation with Colonel Forster?”',\n",

       " '      On his approaching them soon afterwards, though without seeming\\n      to have any intention of speaking, Miss Lucas defied her friend\\n      to mention such a subject to him; which immediately provoking\\n      Elizabeth to do it, she turned to him and said:',\n",
       " '      “Did you not think, Mr. Darcy, that I expressed myself uncommonly\\n      well just now, when I was teasing Colonel Forster to give us a\\n      ball at Meryton?”',\n",
       " '      “With great energy; but it is always a subject which makes a lady\\n      energetic.”',\n",
       " '      “You are severe on us.”',\n",
       " '      “It will be _her_ turn soon to be teased,” said Miss Lucas. “I am\\n      going to open the instrument, Eliza, and you know what follows.”',\n",
       " '      “You are a very strange creature by way of a friend!—always\\n      wanting me to play and sing before anybody and everybody! If my\\n      vanity had taken a musical turn, you would have been invaluable;\\n      but as it is, I would really rather not sit down before those who\\n      must be in the habit of hearing the very best performers.” On\\n      Miss Lucas’s persevering, however, she added, “Very well, if it\\n      must be so, it must.” And gravely glancing at Mr. Darcy, “There\\n      is a fine old saying, which everybody here is of course familiar\\n      with: ‘Keep your breath to cool your porridge’; and I shall keep\\n      mine to swell my song.”',\n",
       " '      Her performance was pleasing, though by no means capital. After a\\n      song or two, and before she could reply to the entreaties of\\n      several that she would sing again, she was eagerly succeeded at\\n      the instrument by her sister Mary, who having, in consequence of\\n      being the only plain one in the family, worked hard for knowledge\\n      and accomplishments, was always impatient for display.',\n",
       " '      Mary had neither genius nor taste; and though vanity had given\\n      her application, it had given her likewise a pedantic air and\\n      conceited manner, which would have injured a higher degree of\\n      excellence than she had reached. Elizabeth, easy and unaffected,\\n      had been listened to with much more pleasure, though not playing\\n      half so well; and Mary, at the end of a long concerto, was glad\\n      to purchase praise and gratitude by Scotch and Irish airs, at the\\n      request of her younger sisters, who, with some of the Lucases,\\n      and two or three officers, joined eagerly in dancing at one end\\n      of the room.',\n",
       " '      Mr. Darcy stood near them in silent indignation at such a mode of\\n      passing the evening, to the exclusion of all conversation, and\\n      was too much engrossed by his thoughts to perceive that Sir\\n      William Lucas was his neighbour, till Sir William thus began:',\n",
       " '      “What a charming amusement for young people this is, Mr. Darcy!\\n      There is nothing like dancing after all. I consider it as one of\\n      the first refinements of polished society.”',\n",
       " '      “Certainly, sir; and it has the advantage also of being in vogue\\n      amongst the less polished societies of the world. Every savage\\n      can dance.”',\n",
       " '      Sir William only smiled. “Your friend performs delightfully,” he\\n      continued after a pause, on seeing Bingley join the group; “and I\\n      doubt not that you are an adept in the science yourself, Mr.\\n      Darcy.”',\n",
       " '      “You saw me dance at Meryton, I believe, sir.”',\n",
       " '      “Yes, indeed, and received no inconsiderable pleasure from the\\n      sight. Do you often dance at St. James’s?”',\n",

       " '      He paused in hopes of an answer; but his companion was not\\n      disposed to make any; and Elizabeth at that instant moving\\n      towards them, he was struck with the action of doing a very\\n      gallant thing, and called out to her:',\n",

       " '      “Indeed, sir, I have not the least intention of dancing. I\\n      entreat you not to suppose that I moved this way in order to beg\\n      for a partner.”',\n",

       " '      “Oh! I am not afraid of her dying. People do not die of little\\n      trifling colds. She will be taken good care of. As long as she\\n      stays there, it is all very well. I would go and see her if I\\n      could have the carriage.”',\n",
       " '      Elizabeth, feeling really anxious, was determined to go to her,\\n      though the carriage was not to be had; and as she was no\\n      horsewoman, walking was her only alternative. She declared her\\n      resolution.',\n",
       " '      “How can you be so silly,” cried her mother, “as to think of such\\n      a thing, in all this dirt! You will not be fit to be seen when\\n      you get there.”',\n",
       " '      “I shall be very fit to see Jane—which is all I want.”',\n",
       " '      “Is this a hint to me, Lizzy,” said her father, “to send for the\\n      horses?”',\n",
       " '      “No, indeed, I do not wish to avoid the walk. The distance is\\n      nothing when one has a motive; only three miles. I shall be back\\n      by dinner.”',\n",
       " '      “I admire the activity of your benevolence,” observed Mary, “but\\n      every impulse of feeling should be guided by reason; and, in my\\n      opinion, exertion should always be in proportion to what is\\n      required.”',\n",
       " '      “We will go as far as Meryton with you,” said Catherine and\\n      Lydia. Elizabeth accepted their company, and the three young\\n      ladies set off together.',\n",
       " '      “If we make haste,” said Lydia, as they walked along, “perhaps we\\n      may see something of Captain Carter before he goes.”',\n",
       " '      In Meryton they parted; the two youngest repaired to the lodgings\\n      of one of the officers’ wives, and Elizabeth continued her walk\\n      alone, crossing field after field at a quick pace, jumping over\\n      stiles and springing over puddles with impatient activity, and\\n      finding herself at last within view of the house, with weary\\n      ankles, dirty stockings, and a face glowing with the warmth of\\n      exercise.',\n",
       " '      She was shown into the breakfast-parlour, where all but Jane were\\n      assembled, and where her appearance created a great deal of\\n      surprise. That she should have walked three miles so early in the\\n      day, in such dirty weather, and by herself, was almost incredible\\n      to Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley; and Elizabeth was convinced that\\n      they held her in contempt for it. She was received, however, very\\n      politely by them; and in their brother’s manners there was\\n      something better than politeness; there was good humour and\\n      kindness. Mr. Darcy said very little, and Mr. Hurst nothing at\\n      all. The former was divided between admiration of the brilliancy\\n      which exercise had given to her complexion, and doubt as to the\\n      occasion’s justifying her coming so far alone. The latter was\\n      thinking only of his breakfast.',\n",
       " '      Her inquiries after her sister were not very favourably answered.\\n      Miss Bennet had slept ill, and though up, was very feverish, and\\n      not well enough to leave her room. Elizabeth was glad to be taken\\n      to her immediately; and Jane, who had only been withheld by the\\n      fear of giving alarm or inconvenience from expressing in her note\\n      how much she longed for such a visit, was delighted at her\\n      entrance. She was not equal, however, to much conversation, and\\n      when Miss Bingley left them together, could attempt little\\n      besides expressions of gratitude for the extraordinary kindness\\n      she was treated with. Elizabeth silently attended her.',\n",
       " '      When breakfast was over they were joined by the sisters; and\\n      Elizabeth began to like them herself, when she saw how much\\n      affection and solicitude they showed for Jane. The apothecary\\n      came, and having examined his patient, said, as might be\\n      supposed, that she had caught a violent cold, and that they must\\n      endeavour to get the better of it; advised her to return to bed,\\n      and promised her some draughts. The advice was followed readily,\\n      for the feverish symptoms increased, and her head ached acutely.\\n      Elizabeth did not quit her room for a moment; nor were the other\\n      ladies often absent; the gentlemen being out, they had, in fact,\\n      nothing to do elsewhere.',\n",
       " '      When the clock struck three, Elizabeth felt that she must go, and\\n      very unwillingly said so. Miss Bingley offered her the carriage,\\n      and she only wanted a little pressing to accept it, when Jane\\n      testified such concern in parting with her, that Miss Bingley was\\n      obliged to convert the offer of the chaise to an invitation to\\n      remain at Netherfield for the present. Elizabeth most thankfully\\n      consented, and a servant was dispatched to Longbourn to acquaint\\n      the family with her stay and bring back a supply of clothes.',\n",

       " '\\n      Chapter 8',\n",
       " '      At five o’clock the two ladies retired to dress, and at half-past\\n      six Elizabeth was summoned to dinner. To the civil inquiries\\n      which then poured in, and amongst which she had the pleasure of\\n      distinguishing the much superior solicitude of Mr. Bingley’s, she\\n      could not make a very favourable answer. Jane was by no means\\n      better. The sisters, on hearing this, repeated three or four\\n      times how much they were grieved, how shocking it was to have a\\n      bad cold, and how excessively they disliked being ill themselves;\\n      and then thought no more of the matter: and their indifference\\n      towards Jane when not immediately before them restored Elizabeth\\n      to the enjoyment of all her former dislike.',\n",
       " '      Their brother, indeed, was the only one of the party whom she\\n      could regard with any complacency. His anxiety for Jane was\\n      evident, and his attentions to herself most pleasing, and they\\n      prevented her feeling herself so much an intruder as she believed\\n      she was considered by the others. She had very little notice from\\n      any but him. Miss Bingley was engrossed by Mr. Darcy, her sister\\n      scarcely less so; and as for Mr. Hurst, by whom Elizabeth sat, he\\n      was an indolent man, who lived only to eat, drink, and play at\\n      cards; who, when he found her to prefer a plain dish to a ragout,\\n      had nothing to say to her.',\n",
       " '      When dinner was over, she returned directly to Jane, and Miss\\n      Bingley began abusing her as soon as she was out of the room. Her\\n      manners were pronounced to be very bad indeed, a mixture of pride\\n      and impertinence; she had no conversation, no style, no beauty.\\n      Mrs. Hurst thought the same, and added:',\n",
       " '      “She has nothing, in short, to recommend her, but being an\\n      excellent walker. I shall never forget her appearance this\\n      morning. She really looked almost wild.”',\n",
       " '      “She did, indeed, Louisa. I could hardly keep my countenance.\\n      Very nonsensical to come at all! Why must _she_ be scampering\\n      about the country, because her sister had a cold? Her hair, so\\n      untidy, so blowsy!”',\n",
       " '      “Yes, and her petticoat; I hope you saw her petticoat, six inches\\n      deep in mud, I am absolutely certain; and the gown which had been\\n      let down to hide it not doing its office.”',\n",
       " '      “Your picture may be very exact, Louisa,” said Bingley; “but this\\n      was all lost upon me. I thought Miss Elizabeth Bennet looked\\n      remarkably well when she came into the room this morning. Her\\n      dirty petticoat quite escaped my notice.”',\n",
       " '      “_You_ observed it, Mr. Darcy, I am sure,” said Miss Bingley;\\n      “and I am inclined to think that you would not wish to see _your\\n      sister_ make such an exhibition.”',\n",
       " '      “Certainly not.”',\n",
       " '      “To walk three miles, or four miles, or five miles, or whatever\\n      it is, above her ankles in dirt, and alone, quite alone! What\\n      could she mean by it? It seems to me to show an abominable sort\\n      of conceited independence, a most country-town indifference to\\n      decorum.”',\n",
       " '      “It shows an affection for her sister that is very pleasing,”\\n      said Bingley.',\n",
       " '      “I am afraid, Mr. Darcy,” observed Miss Bingley in a half\\n      whisper, “that this adventure has rather affected your admiration\\n      of her fine eyes.”',\n",
       " '      “Not at all,” he replied; “they were brightened by the exercise.”\\n      A short pause followed this speech, and Mrs. Hurst began again:',\n",
       " '      “I have an excessive regard for Miss Jane Bennet, she is really a\\n      very sweet girl, and I wish with all my heart she were well\\n      settled. But with such a father and mother, and such low\\n      connections, I am afraid there is no chance of it.”',\n",
       " '      “I think I have heard you say that their uncle is an attorney in\\n      Meryton.”',\n",
       " '      “Yes; and they have another, who lives somewhere near Cheapside.”',\n",
       " '      “That is capital,” added her sister, and they both laughed\\n      heartily.',\n",
       " '      “If they had uncles enough to fill _all_ Cheapside,” cried\\n      Bingley, “it would not make them one jot less agreeable.”',\n",
       " '      “But it must very materially lessen their chance of marrying men\\n      of any consideration in the world,” replied Darcy.',\n",
       " '      To this speech Bingley made no answer; but his sisters gave it\\n      their hearty assent, and indulged their mirth for some time at\\n      the expense of their dear friend’s vulgar relations.',\n",
       " '      With a renewal of tenderness, however, they returned to her room\\n      on leaving the dining-parlour, and sat with her till summoned to\\n      coffee. She was still very poorly, and Elizabeth would not quit\\n      her at all, till late in the evening, when she had the comfort of\\n      seeing her sleep, and when it seemed to her rather right than\\n      pleasant that she should go downstairs herself. On entering the\\n      drawing-room she found the whole party at loo, and was\\n      immediately invited to join them; but suspecting them to be\\n      playing high she declined it, and making her sister the excuse,\\n      said she would amuse herself for the short time she could stay\\n      below, with a book. Mr. Hurst looked at her with astonishment.',\n",
       " '      “Do you prefer reading to cards?” said he; “that is rather\\n      singular.”',\n",
       " '      “Miss Eliza Bennet,” said Miss Bingley, “despises cards. She is a\\n      great reader, and has no pleasure in anything else.”',\n",
       " '      “I deserve neither such praise nor such censure,” cried\\n      Elizabeth; “I am _not_ a great reader, and I have pleasure in\\n      many things.”',\n",
       " '      “In nursing your sister I am sure you have pleasure,” said\\n      Bingley; “and I hope it will be soon increased by seeing her\\n      quite well.”',\n",
       " '      Elizabeth thanked him from her heart, and then walked towards the\\n      table where a few books were lying. He immediately offered to\\n      fetch her others—all that his library afforded.',\n",
       " '      “And I wish my collection were larger for your benefit and my own\\n      credit; but I am an idle fellow, and though I have not many, I\\n      have more than I ever looked into.”',\n",
       " '      Elizabeth assured him that she could suit herself perfectly with\\n      those in the room.',\n",
       " '      “I am astonished,” said Miss Bingley, “that my father should have\\n      left so small a collection of books. What a delightful library\\n      you have at Pemberley, Mr. Darcy!”',\n",
       " '      “It ought to be good,” he replied, “it has been the work of many\\n      generations.”',\n",
       " '      “And then you have added so much to it yourself, you are always\\n      buying books.”',\n",
       " '      “I cannot comprehend the neglect of a family library in such days\\n      as these.”',\n",
       " '      “Neglect! I am sure you neglect nothing that can add to the\\n      beauties of that noble place. Charles, when you build _your_\\n      house, I wish it may be half as delightful as Pemberley.”',\n",
       " '      “I wish it may.”',\n",
       " '      “But I would really advise you to make your purchase in that\\n      neighbourhood, and take Pemberley for a kind of model. There is\\n      not a finer county in England than Derbyshire.”',\n",
       " '      “With all my heart; I will buy Pemberley itself if Darcy will\\n      sell it.”',\n",
       " '      “I am talking of possibilities, Charles.”',\n",
       " '      “Upon my word, Caroline, I should think it more possible to get\\n      Pemberley by purchase than by imitation.”',\n",
       " '      Elizabeth was so much caught with what passed, as to leave her\\n      very little attention for her book; and soon laying it wholly\\n      aside, she drew near the card-table, and stationed herself\\n      between Mr. Bingley and his eldest sister, to observe the game.',\n",
       " '      “Is Miss Darcy much grown since the spring?” said Miss Bingley;\\n      “will she be as tall as I am?”',\n",
       " '      “I think she will. She is now about Miss Elizabeth Bennet’s\\n      height, or rather taller.”',\n",
       " '      “How I long to see her again! I never met with anybody who\\n      delighted me so much. Such a countenance, such manners! And so\\n      extremely accomplished for her age! Her performance on the\\n      pianoforte is exquisite.”',\n",
       " '      “It is amazing to me,” said Bingley, “how young ladies can have\\n      patience to be so very accomplished as they all are.”',\n",
       " '      “All young ladies accomplished! My dear Charles, what do you\\n      mean?”',\n",
       " '      “Yes, all of them, I think. They all paint tables, cover screens,\\n      and net purses. I scarcely know anyone who cannot do all this,\\n      and I am sure I never heard a young lady spoken of for the first\\n      time, without being informed that she was very accomplished.”',\n",
       " '      “Your list of the common extent of accomplishments,” said Darcy,\\n      “has too much truth. The word is applied to many a woman who\\n      deserves it no otherwise than by netting a purse or covering a\\n      screen. But I am very far from agreeing with you in your\\n      estimation of ladies in general. I cannot boast of knowing more\\n      than half-a-dozen, in the whole range of my acquaintance, that\\n      are really accomplished.”',\n",
       " '      “Nor I, I am sure,” said Miss Bingley.',\n",
       " '      “Then,” observed Elizabeth, “you must comprehend a great deal in\\n      your idea of an accomplished woman.”',\n",
       " '      “Yes, I do comprehend a great deal in it.”',\n",
       " '      “Oh! certainly,” cried his faithful assistant, “no one can be\\n      really esteemed accomplished who does not greatly surpass what is\\n      usually met with. A woman must have a thorough knowledge of\\n      music, singing, drawing, dancing, and the modern languages, to\\n      deserve the word; and besides all this, she must possess a\\n      certain something in her air and manner of walking, the tone of\\n      her voice, her address and expressions, or the word will be but\\n      half-deserved.”',\n",
       " '      “All this she must possess,” added Darcy, “and to all this she\\n      must yet add something more substantial, in the improvement of\\n      her mind by extensive reading.”',\n",
       " '      “I am no longer surprised at your knowing _only_ six accomplished\\n      women. I rather wonder now at your knowing _any_.”',\n",
       " '      “Are you so severe upon your own sex as to doubt the possibility\\n      of all this?”',\n",
       " '      “_I_ never saw such a woman. _I_ never saw such capacity, and\\n      taste, and application, and elegance, as you describe united.”',\n",
       " '      Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley both cried out against the injustice\\n      of her implied doubt, and were both protesting that they knew\\n      many women who answered this description, when Mr. Hurst called\\n      them to order, with bitter complaints of their inattention to\\n      what was going forward. As all conversation was thereby at an\\n      end, Elizabeth soon afterwards left the room.',\n",
       " '      “Elizabeth Bennet,” said Miss Bingley, when the door was closed\\n      on her, “is one of those young ladies who seek to recommend\\n      themselves to the other sex by undervaluing their own; and with\\n      many men, I dare say, it succeeds. But, in my opinion, it is a\\n      paltry device, a very mean art.”',\n",
       " '      “Undoubtedly,” replied Darcy, to whom this remark was chiefly\\n      addressed, “there is a meanness in _all_ the arts which ladies\\n      sometimes condescend to employ for captivation. Whatever bears\\n      affinity to cunning is despicable.”',\n",
       " '      Miss Bingley was not so entirely satisfied with this reply as to\\n      continue the subject.',\n",
       " '      Elizabeth joined them again only to say that her sister was\\n      worse, and that she could not leave her. Bingley urged Mr. Jones\\n      being sent for immediately; while his sisters, convinced that no\\n      country advice could be of any service, recommended an express to\\n      town for one of the most eminent physicians. This she would not\\n      hear of; but she was not so unwilling to comply with their\\n      brother’s proposal; and it was settled that Mr. Jones should be\\n      sent for early in the morning, if Miss Bennet were not decidedly\\n      better. Bingley was quite uncomfortable; his sisters declared\\n      that they were miserable. They solaced their wretchedness,\\n      however, by duets after supper, while he could find no better\\n      relief to his feelings than by giving his housekeeper directions\\n      that every attention might be paid to the sick lady and her\\n      sister.',\n",

       " '      Elizabeth passed the chief of the night in her sister’s room, and\\n      in the morning had the pleasure of being able to send a tolerable\\n      answer to the inquiries which she very early received from Mr.\\n      Bingley by a housemaid, and some time afterwards from the two\\n      elegant ladies who waited on his sisters. In spite of this\\n      amendment, however, she requested to have a note sent to\\n      Longbourn, desiring her mother to visit Jane, and form her own\\n      judgement of her situation. The note was immediately dispatched,\\n      and its contents as quickly complied with. Mrs. Bennet,\\n      accompanied by her two youngest girls, reached Netherfield soon\\n      after the family breakfast.',\n",
       " '      Had she found Jane in any apparent danger, Mrs. Bennet would have\\n      been very miserable; but being satisfied on seeing her that her\\n      illness was not alarming, she had no wish of her recovering\\n      immediately, as her restoration to health would probably remove\\n      her from Netherfield. She would not listen, therefore, to her\\n      daughter’s proposal of being carried home; neither did the\\n      apothecary, who arrived about the same time, think it at all\\n      advisable. After sitting a little while with Jane, on Miss\\n      Bingley’s appearance and invitation, the mother and three\\n      daughters all attended her into the breakfast parlour. Bingley\\n      met them with hopes that Mrs. Bennet had not found Miss Bennet\\n      worse than she expected.',\n",
       " '      “Indeed I have, sir,” was her answer. “She is a great deal too\\n      ill to be moved. Mr. Jones says we must not think of moving her.\\n      We must trespass a little longer on your kindness.”',\n",
       " '      “Removed!” cried Bingley. “It must not be thought of. My sister,\\n      I am sure, will not hear of her removal.”',\n",
       " '      “You may depend upon it, Madam,” said Miss Bingley, with cold\\n      civility, “that Miss Bennet will receive every possible attention\\n      while she remains with us.”',\n",
       " '      Mrs. Bennet was profuse in her acknowledgments.',\n",
       " '      “I am sure,” she added, “if it was not for such good friends I do\\n      not know what would become of her, for she is very ill indeed,\\n      and suffers a vast deal, though with the greatest patience in the\\n      world, which is always the way with her, for she has, without\\n      exception, the sweetest temper I have ever met with. I often tell\\n      my other girls they are nothing to _her_. You have a sweet room\\n      here, Mr. Bingley, and a charming prospect over the gravel walk.\\n      I do not know a place in the country that is equal to\\n      Netherfield. You will not think of quitting it in a hurry, I\\n      hope, though you have but a short lease.”',\n",
       " '      “Whatever I do is done in a hurry,” replied he; “and therefore if\\n      I should resolve to quit Netherfield, I should probably be off in\\n      five minutes. At present, however, I consider myself as quite\\n      fixed here.”',\n",
       " '      “That is exactly what I should have supposed of you,” said\\n      Elizabeth.',\n",

       " '      “Yes, but intricate characters are the _most_ amusing. They have\\n      at least that advantage.”',\n",
       " '      “The country,” said Darcy, “can in general supply but a few\\n      subjects for such a study. In a country neighbourhood you move in\\n      a very confined and unvarying society.”',\n",

       " '      Everybody was surprised, and Darcy, after looking at her for a\\n      moment, turned silently away. Mrs. Bennet, who fancied she had\\n      gained a complete victory over him, continued her triumph.',\n",

       " '      “When I am in the country,” he replied, “I never wish to leave\\n      it; and when I am in town it is pretty much the same. They have\\n      each their advantages, and I can be equally happy in either.”',\n",
       " '      “Aye—that is because you have the right disposition. But that\\n      gentleman,” looking at Darcy, “seemed to think the country was\\n      nothing at all.”',\n",

       " '      Nothing but concern for Elizabeth could enable Bingley to keep\\n      his countenance.

Elizabeth,\\n      for the sake of saying something that might turn her mother’s\\n      thoughts, now asked her if Charlotte Lucas had been at Longbourn\\n      since _her_ coming away.',\n",
       " '      “Yes, she called yesterday with her father. What an agreeable man\\n      Sir William is, Mr. Bingley, is not he? So much the man of\\n      fashion! So genteel and easy! He has always something to say to\\n      everybody. _That_ is my idea of good breeding; and those persons\\n      who fancy themselves very important, and never open their mouths,\\n      quite mistake the matter.”',\n",
       " '      “Did Charlotte dine with you?”',\n",
       " '      “No, she would go home. I fancy she was wanted about the\\n      mince-pies. For my part, Mr. Bingley, _I_ always keep servants\\n      that can do their own work; _my_ daughters are brought up very\\n      differently. But everybody is to judge for themselves, and the\\n      Lucases are a very good sort of girls, I assure you. It is a pity\\n      they are not handsome! Not that _I_ think Charlotte so _very_\\n      plain—but then she is our particular friend.”',\n",
       " '      “She seems a very pleasant young woman.”',\n",
       " '      “Oh! dear, yes; but you must own she is very plain. Lady Lucas\\n      herself has often said so, and envied me Jane’s beauty. I do not\\n      like to boast of my own child, but to be sure, Jane—one does not\\n      often see anybody better looking. It is what everybody says. I do\\n      not trust my own partiality. When she was only fifteen, there was\\n      a man at my brother Gardiner’s in town so much in love with her\\n      that my sister-in-law was sure he would make her an offer before\\n      we came away. But, however, he did not. Perhaps he thought her\\n      too young. However, he wrote some verses on her, and very pretty\\n      they were.”',\n",
       " '      “And so ended his affection,” said Elizabeth impatiently. “There\\n      has been many a one, I fancy, overcome in the same way. I wonder\\n      who first discovered the efficacy of poetry in driving away\\n      love!”',\n",
       " '      “I have been used to consider poetry as the _food_ of love,” said\\n      Darcy.',\n",
       " '      “Of a fine, stout, healthy love it may. Everything nourishes what\\n      is strong already. But if it be only a slight, thin sort of\\n      inclination, I am convinced that one good sonnet will starve it\\n      entirely away.”',\n",
       " '      Darcy only smiled; and the general pause which ensued made\\n      Elizabeth tremble lest her mother should be exposing herself\\n      again. She longed to speak, but could think of nothing to say;\\n      and after a short silence Mrs. Bennet began repeating her thanks\\n      to Mr. Bingley for his kindness to Jane, with an apology for\\n      troubling him also with Lizzy. Mr. Bingley was unaffectedly civil\\n      in his answer, and forced his younger sister to be civil also,\\n      and say what the occasion required. She performed her part indeed\\n      without much graciousness, but Mrs. Bennet was satisfied, and\\n      soon afterwards ordered her carriage. Upon this signal, the\\n      youngest of her daughters put herself forward. The two girls had\\n      been whispering to each other during the whole visit, and the\\n      result of it was, that the youngest should tax Mr. Bingley with\\n      having promised on his first coming into the country to give a\\n      ball at Netherfield.',\n",
       " '      Lydia was a stout, well-grown girl of fifteen, with a fine\\n      complexion and good-humoured countenance; a favourite with her\\n      mother, whose affection had brought her into public at an early\\n      age. She had high animal spirits, and a sort of natural\\n      self-consequence, which the attention of the officers, to whom\\n      her uncle’s good dinners, and her own easy manners recommended\\n      her, had increased into assurance. She was very equal, therefore,\\n      to address Mr. Bingley on the subject of the ball, and abruptly\\n      reminded him of his promise; adding, that it would be the most\\n      shameful thing in the world if he did not keep it. His answer to\\n      this sudden attack was delightful to their mother’s ear:',\n",
       " '      “I am perfectly ready, I assure you, to keep my engagement; and\\n      when your sister is recovered, you shall, if you please, name the\\n      very day of the ball. But you would not wish to be dancing when\\n      she is ill.”',\n",
       " '      Lydia declared herself satisfied. “Oh! yes—it would be much\\n      better to wait till Jane was well, and by that time most likely\\n      Captain Carter would be at Meryton again.

The power of\\n      doing anything with quickness is always prized much by the\\n      possessor, and often without any attention to the imperfection of\\n      the performance.

At length, quite\\n      exhausted by the attempt to be amused with her own book, which\\n      she had only chosen because it was the second volume of his, she\\n      gave a great yawn and said, “How pleasant it is to spend an\\n      evening in this way! I declare after all there is no enjoyment\\n      like reading! How much sooner one tires of anything than of a\\n      book! When I have a house of my own, I shall be miserable if I\\n      have not an excellent library.”',\n",
       " '      No one made any reply. She then yawned again, threw aside her\\n      book, and cast her eyes round the room in quest for some\\n      amusement; when hearing her brother mentioning a ball to Miss\\n      Bennet, she turned suddenly towards him and said:',\n",
       " '      “By the bye, Charles, are you really serious in meditating a\\n      dance at Netherfield? I would advise you, before you determine on\\n      it, to consult the wishes of the present party; I am much\\n      mistaken if there are not some among us to whom a ball would be\\n      rather a punishment than a pleasure.”',\n",
       " '      “If you mean Darcy,” cried her brother, “he may go to bed, if he\\n      chooses, before it begins—but as for the ball, it is quite a\\n      settled thing; and as soon as Nicholls has made white soup\\n      enough, I shall send round my cards.”',\n",
       " '      “I should like balls infinitely better,” she replied, “if they\\n      were carried on in a different manner; but there is something\\n      insufferably tedious in the usual process of such a meeting. It\\n      would surely be much more rational if conversation instead of\\n      dancing were made the order of the day.”',\n",
       " '      “Much more rational, my dear Caroline, I dare say, but it would\\n      not be near so much like a ball.”',\n",
       " '      Miss Bingley made no answer, and soon afterwards she got up and\\n      walked about the room. Her figure was elegant, and she walked\\n      well; but Darcy, at whom it was all aimed, was still inflexibly\\n      studious. In the desperation of her feelings, she resolved on one\\n      effort more, and, turning to Elizabeth, said:',\n",
       " '      “Miss Eliza Bennet, let me persuade you to follow my example, and\\n      take a turn about the room. I assure you it is very refreshing\\n      after sitting so long in one attitude.”',\n",
       " '      Elizabeth was surprised, but agreed to it immediately. Miss\\n      Bingley succeeded no less in the real object of her civility; Mr.\\n      Darcy looked up. He was as much awake to the novelty of attention\\n      in that quarter as Elizabeth herself could be, and unconsciously\\n      closed his book. He was directly invited to join their party, but\\n      he declined it, observing that he could imagine but two motives\\n      for their choosing to walk up and down the room together, with\\n      either of which motives his joining them would interfere. “What\\n      could he mean? She was dying to know what could be his\\n      meaning?”—and asked Elizabeth whether she could at all understand\\n      him?',\n",
       " '      “Not at all,” was her answer; “but depend upon it, he means to be\\n      severe on us, and our surest way of disappointing him will be to\\n      ask nothing about it.”',\n",
       " '      Miss Bingley, however, was incapable of disappointing Mr. Darcy\\n      in anything, and persevered therefore in requiring an explanation\\n      of his two motives.',\n",
       " '      “I have not the smallest objection to explaining them,” said he,\\n      as soon as she allowed him to speak. “You either choose this\\n      method of passing the evening because you are in each other’s\\n      confidence, and have secret affairs to discuss, or because you\\n      are conscious that your figures appear to the greatest advantage\\n      in walking; if the first, I would be completely in your way, and\\n      if the second, I can admire you much better as I sit by the\\n      fire.”',\n",
       " '      “Oh! shocking!” cried Miss Bingley. “I never heard anything so\\n      abominable. How shall we punish him for such a speech?”',\n",
       " '      “Nothing so easy, if you have but the inclination,” said\\n      Elizabeth. “We can all plague and punish one another. Tease\\n      him—laugh at him. Intimate as you are, you must know how it is to\\n      be done.”',\n",
       " '      “But upon my honour, I do _not_. I do assure you that my intimacy\\n      has not yet taught me _that_. Tease calmness of manner and\\n      presence of mind! No, no; I feel he may defy us there. And as to\\n      laughter, we will not expose ourselves, if you please, by\\n      attempting to laugh without a subject. Mr. Darcy may hug\\n      himself.”',\n",
       " '      “Mr. Darcy is not to be laughed at!” cried Elizabeth. “That is an\\n      uncommon advantage, and uncommon I hope it will continue, for it\\n      would be a great loss to _me_ to have many such acquaintances. I\\n      dearly love a laugh.”',\n",
       " '      “Miss Bingley,” said he, “has given me more credit than can be.\\n      The wisest and the best of men—nay, the wisest and best of their\\n      actions—may be rendered ridiculous by a person whose first object\\n      in life is a joke.”',\n",
       " '      “Certainly,” replied Elizabeth—“there are such people, but I hope\\n      I am not one of _them_. I hope I never ridicule what is wise and\\n      good. Follies and nonsense, whims and inconsistencies, _do_\\n      divert me, I own, and I laugh at them whenever I can. But these,\\n      I suppose, are precisely what you are without.”\\n']"
